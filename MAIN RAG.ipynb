Designed for a two semester (CS1 and CS2) C++ course, this text will provide a breath\\nof fresh air to you and your students. The CS1 and CS2 courses serve as the cornerstone of the\\nComputer Science curriculum. My primary goal is to motivate and excite all introduc-\\ntory programming students, regardless of their level. Motivation breeds excitement for\\nlearning. Motivation and excitement are critical factors that lead to the success of the\\nprogramming student. This text is a culmination and development of my classroom notes\\nthroughout more than fifty semesters of teaching successful programming to Computer\\nScience students.\\nC++ Programming: Program Design Including Data Structures started as a collection of brief\\nexamples, exercises, and lengthy programming examples to supplement the books that were\\nin use at our university. It soon turned into a collection large enough to develop into a text.\\nThe approach taken in this book is, in fact, driven by the students’ demand for clarity and readability.\\nThe material was written and rewritten until the students felt comfortable with it. Most of the\\nexamples in this book resulted from student interaction in the classroom.\\nAs with any profession, practice is essential. Cooking students practice their recipes. Budding\\nviolinists practice their scales. New programmers must practice solving problems and writing\\ncode. This is not a C++ cookbook. We do not simply list the C++ syntax followed by an\\nexample; we dissect the ‘‘why?’’ behind all the concepts. The crucial question of ‘‘why?’’ is\\nanswered for every topic when first introduced. This technique offers a bridge to learning\\nC++. Students must understand the ‘‘why?’’ in order to be motivated to learn.\\nTraditionally, a C++ programming neophyte needed a working knowledge of another\\nprogramming language. This book assumes no prior programming experience. However,\\nsome adequate mathematics background such as college algebra is required.\\nPREFACE\\nWarning: This text can be expected to create a serious reduction in the demand for program-\\nming help during your office hours. Other side effects include significantly diminished student\\ndependency on others while learning to program.\\nª HunThomas/Shutterstock.com\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

A special feature of the seventh edition is the mapping of end-of-chapter\\nexercises with their respective learning objective(s) listed at the beginning of the chapter.\\nThe first part of Chapter 4 is reorganized by introducing the if and if...else structures\\nearlier. Also, the first part of Chapter 5 is rewritten. This edition also introduces some features\\nof C++11, such as range-based for loops, in Chapter 8, and illustrates how to use them to\\nprocess the elements of an array, in Chapters 8 and 12, and on sequence containers, in\\nChapter 21. We have also included various new examples, such as Examples 2-19, 3-12,\\n3-13, 3-14, 4-14, 6-5, 6-16, 8-7, 10-11, 11-4, 13-1, and 21-6.\\nApproach\\nThe programming language C++, which evolved from C, is no longer considered an\\nindustry-only language. Numerous colleges and universities use C++ for their first program-\\nming language course. C++ is a combination of structured programming and object-oriented\\nprogramming, and this book addresses both types.\\nThis book is intended for a two-semester course, CS1 and CS2, in Computer Science. The first\\n10 or 11 chapters can be covered in the first course and the remaining in the second course.\\nIn July 1998, ANSI/ISO Standard C++ was officially approved. This book focuses on ANSI/\\nISO Standard C++. Even though the syntax of Standard C++ and ANSI/ISO Standard C++\\nis very similar, Chapter 7 discusses some of the features of ANSI/ISO Standard C++ that are\\nnot available in Standard C++.\\nChapter 1 briefly reviews the history of computers and programming languages. The reader can\\nquickly skim through this chapter and become familiar with some of the hardware components\\nand the software parts of the computer. This chapter contains a section on processing a C++\\nprogram. This chapter also describes structured and object-oriented programming.\\nChapter 2 discusses the basic elements of C++. After completing this chapter, students\\nbecome familiar with the basics of C++ and are ready to write programs that are complicated\\nenough to do some computations. Input/output is fundamental to any programming lan-\\nguage. It is introduced early, in Chapter 3, and is covered in detail.\\nChapters 4 and 5 introduce control structures to alter the sequential flow of execution.\\nChapter 6 studies user-defined functions. It is recommended that readers with no prior\\nprogramming background spend extra time on Chapter 6. Several examples are provided to\\nhelp readers understand the concepts of parameter passing and the scope of an identifier.\\nChapter 7 discusses the user-defined simple data type (enumeration type), the namespace\\nmechanism of ANSI/ISO Standard C++, and the string type. The earlier versions of C did\\nnot include the enumeration type. Enumeration types have very limited use; their main\\npurpose is to make the program readable.

This chapter also introduces range-based for loops, a feature\\nof C++11 Standard, and explains how to use them to process the elements of an array.\\nLimitations of ranged-based for loops on arrays passed as parameters to functions are also\\ndiscussed. Chapter 8 also discusses a sequential search algorithm and a selection sort algorithm.\\nChapter 9 introduces records (structs). The introduction of structs in this book is similar to\\nC structs. This chapter is optional; it is not a prerequisite for any of the remaining chapters.\\nChapter 10 begins the study of object-oriented programming (OOP) and introduces classes.\\nThe first half of this chapter shows how classes are defined and used in a program. The second\\nhalf of the chapter introduces abstract data types (ADTs). This chapter shows how classes in\\nC++ are a natural way to implement ADTs. Chapter 11 continues with the fundamentals of\\nobject-oriented design (OOD) and OOP, and discusses inheritance and composition. It\\nexplains how classes in C++ provide a natural mechanism for OOD and how C++ supports\\nOOP. Chapter 11 also discusses how to find the objects in a given problem.\\nChapter 12 studies pointers in detail. After introducing pointers and how to use them in a\\nprogram, this chapter highlights the peculiarities of classes with pointer data members and\\nhow to avoid them. Moreover, this chapter discusses how to create and work with dynamic\\ntwo-dimensional arrays, and also explains why ranged-based for loops cannot be used on\\ndynamic arrays. Chapter 12 also discusses abstract classes and a type of polymorphism\\naccomplished via virtual functions.\\nChapter 13 continues the study of OOD and OOP. In particular, it studies polymorphism in C++.\\nChapter 13 specifically discusses two types of polymorphism—overloading and templates.\\nChapter 14 discusses exception handling in detail. Chapter 15 introduces and discusses\\nrecursion. This is a stand-alone chapter, so it can be studied anytime after Chapter 9.\\nChapters 16 and 17 are devoted to the study of data structures. Discussed in detail are linked\\nlists in Chapter 16 and stacks and queues in Chapter 17. The programming code developed in\\nthese chapters is generic. These chapters effectively use the fundamentals of OOD.\\nChapter 18 discusses various searching and sorting algorithms. In addition to showing how\\nthese algorithms work, it also provides relevant analysis and results concerning the perfor-\\nmance of the algorithms. The algorithm analysis allows the user to decide which algorithm to\\nuse in a particular application. This chapter also includes several sorting algorithms. The\\ninstructor can decide which algorithms to cover.\\nChapter 19 provides an introduction to binary trees. Various traversal algorithms, as well as the\\nbasic properties of binary trees, are discussed and illustrated. Special binary trees, called binary\\nsearch trees, are introduced. Searching, as well as item insertion and deletion from a binary search\\ntree, are described and illustrated. Chapter 19 also discusses nonrecursive binary tree traversal\\nalgorithms. Furthermore, to enhance the flexibility of traversal algorithms, it shows how to\\nconstruct and pass functions as parameters to other functions. This chapter also discusses AVL\\n(height balanced) trees in detail. Because of text length considerations, discussion on AVL trees is\\nprovided as a separate section and is available on the Web site accompanying this book.\\nPreface\\n|\\nxxxvii\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

After introducing the basic graph theory\\nterminology, the representation of graphs in computer memory is discussed. This chapter\\nalso discusses graph traversal algorithms, the shortest path algorithm, and the minimal span-\\nning tree algorithm. Topological sort is also discussed in this chapter and is available on the\\nWeb site accompanying this book.\\nC++ is equipped with a powerful library—the Standard Template Library (STL)—of data\\nstructures and algorithms that can be used effectively in a wide variety of applications. Chapter\\n21 describes the STL in detail. After introducing the three basic components of the STL, it shows\\nhow sequence containers are used in a program. Special containers, such as stacks and queues, are\\nalso discussed. The latter half of this chapter shows how various STL algorithms can be used in a\\nprogram. This chapter is fairly long; depending on the availability of time, the instructor can at least\\ncover the sequence containers, iterators, the classes stack and queue, and certain algorithms.\\nAppendix A lists the reserved words in C++. Appendix B shows the precedence and\\nassociativity of the C++ operators. Appendix C lists the ASCII (American Standard Code\\nfor Information Interchange) and EBCDIC (Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange\\nCode) character sets. Appendix D lists the C++ operators that can be overloaded.\\nAppendix E has three objectives. First, we discuss how to convert a number from decimal to\\nbinary and binary to decimal. We then discuss binary and random access files in detail. Finally,\\nwe describe the naming conventions of the header files in both ANSI/ISO Standard C++ and\\nStandard C++. Appendix F discusses some of the most widely used library routines, and\\nincludes the names of the standard C++ header files. The programs in Appendix G show\\nhow to print the memory size for the built-in data types on your system as well as how to use a\\nrandom number generator. Appendix H gives selected references for further study. Appendix I\\nprovides the answers to odd-numbered exercises in the book.\\nIn Figure 1, dotted lines mean that the preceding chapter is used in one of the sections of the\\nchapter and is not necessarily a prerequisite for the next chapter. For example, Chapter 8\\ncovers arrays in detail. In Chapters 9 and 10, we show the relationship between arrays and\\nstructs and arrays and classes, respectively. However, if Chapter 10 is studied before\\nChapter 8, then the section dealing with arrays in Chapter 10 can be skipped without any\\ndiscontinuation. This particular section can be studied after studying Chapter 8.\\nIt is recommended that the first six chapters be covered sequentially. After covering the first\\nsix chapters, if the reader is interested in learning OOD and OOP early, then Chapter 10 can\\nbe studied right after Chapter 6. Chapter 7 can be studied anytime after Chapter 6. After\\nstudying the first six chapters in sequence, some of the approaches are:\\n1.\\nStudy chapters in the sequence: 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21.\\n2.\\nStudy chapters in the sequence: 8, 10, 12, 13, 11, 15, 16, 17, 14, 18, 19, 20, 21\\n3.\\nStudy chapters in the sequence: 10, 8, 12, 13, 11, 15, 16, 17, 14, 18, 19, 20, 21.\\nAs the chapter dependency diagram shows, Chapters 17 and 18 can be covered in any sequence.\\nHowever, typically, Chapters 17 and 18 are studied in sequence. Ideally, one should study\\nChapters 16, 17, 18, and 19 in sequence.

Many people use the Internet to look for information and\\nto communicate with others. This is all made possible by the use of various software, also\\nknown as computer programs. Without software, a computer cannot work. Software is\\ndeveloped by using programming languages. C++ is one of the programming languages,\\nwhich is well suited for developing software to accomplish specific tasks. The main objective\\nof this book is to help you learn C++ programming language to write programs. Before you\\nbegin programming, it is useful to understand some of the basic terminology and different\\ncomponents of a computer. We begin with an overview of the history of computers.\\nA Brief Overview of the History of Computers\\nThe first device known to carry out calculations was the abacus. The abacus was invented in\\nAsia but was used in ancient Babylon, China, and throughout Europe until the late middle\\nages. The abacus uses a system of sliding beads in a rack for addition and subtraction. In 1642,\\nthe French philosopher and mathematician Blaise Pascal invented the calculating device\\ncalled the Pascaline. It had eight movable dials on wheels and could calculate sums up to\\neight figures long. Both the abacus and Pascaline could perform only addition and subtrac-\\ntion operations. Later in the 17th century, Gottfried von Leibniz invented a device that was\\nable to add, subtract, multiply, and divide. In 1819, Joseph Jacquard, a French weaver,\\ndiscovered that the weaving instructions for his looms could be stored on cards with holes\\npunched in them. While the cards moved through the loom in sequence, needles passed\\nthrough the holes and picked up threads of the correct color and texture. A weaver could\\nrearrange the cards and change the pattern being woven. In essence, the cards programmed a\\nloom to produce patterns in cloth. The weaving industry may seem to have little in common\\nwith the computer industry. However, the idea of storing information by punching holes on\\na card proved to be of great importance in the later development of computers.\\nIn the early and mid-1800s, Charles Babbage, an English mathematician and physical\\nscientist, designed two calculating machines: the difference engine and the analytical\\nengine. The difference engine could perform complex operations such as squaring numbers\\nautomatically. Babbage built a prototype of the difference engine, but did not build the\\nactual device. The first complete difference engine was completed in London in 2002,\\n153 years after it was designed. It consists of 8,000 parts, weighs five tons, and measures 11\\nfeet long. A replica of the difference engine was completed in 2008 and is on display at the\\nComputer History Museum in Mountain View, California (http://www.computerhistory.org/\\nbabbage/). Most of Babbage’s work is known through the writings of his colleague Ada\\nAugusta, Countess of Lovelace. Augusta is considered the first computer programmer.\\nAt the end of the 19th century, U.S. Census officials needed help in accurately tabulating\\nthe census data. Herman Hollerith invented a calculating machine that ran on electricity\\nand used punched cards to store data. Hollerith’s machine was immensely successful.\\n2\\n|\\nChapter 1: An Overview of Computers and Programming Languages\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

It was built, in 1944, jointly by IBM and\\nHarvard University under the leadership of Howard Aiken. Punched cards were used to feed\\ndata into the machine. The Mark I was 52 feet long, weighed 50 tons, and had 750,000 parts.\\nIn 1946, the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Calculator (ENIAC) was built at the\\nUniversity of Pennsylvania. It contained 18,000 vacuum tubes and weighed some 30 tons.\\nThe computers that we know today use the design rules given by John von Neumann in\\nthe late 1940s. His design included components such as an arithmetic logic unit, a control\\nunit, memory, and input/output devices. These components are described in the next\\nsection. Von Neumann’s computer design makes it possible to store the programming\\ninstructions and the data in the same memory space. In 1951, the Universal Automatic\\nComputer (UNIVAC) was built and sold to the U.S. Census Bureau.\\nIn 1956, the invention of transistors resulted in smaller, faster, more reliable, and more\\nenergy-efficient computers. This era also saw the emergence of the software development\\nindustry, with the introduction of FORTRAN and COBOL, two early programming\\nlanguages. In the next major technological advancement, transistors were replaced by\\nsmall-sized integrated circuits, or ‘‘chips.’’ Chips are much smaller and more efficient than\\ntransistors, and with today’s new technology it can be made to contain thousands of\\ncircuits on a single chip. They give computers tremendous processing speed.\\nIn 1970, the microprocessor, an entire central processing unit (CPU) on a single chip,\\nwas invented. In 1977, Stephen Wozniak and Steven Jobs designed and built the first\\nApple computer in their garage. In 1981, IBM introduced its personal computer (PC). In\\nthe 1980s, clones of the IBM PC made the personal computer even more affordable. By\\nthe mid-1990s, people from many walks of life were able to afford them. Computers\\ncontinue to become faster and less expensive as technology advances.\\nModern-day computers are powerful, reliable, and easy to use. They can accept spoken-word\\ninstructions and imitate human reasoning through artificial intelligence. Expert systems assist\\ndoctors in making diagnoses. Mobile computing applications are growing significantly. Using\\nhand-held devices, delivery drivers can access global positioning satellites (GPS) to verify\\ncustomer locations for pickups and deliveries. Cell phones permit you to check your e-mail,\\nmake airline reservations, see how stocks are performing, access your bank accounts, and\\ncommunicate with family and friends via social media.\\nAlthough there are several categories of computers, such as mainframe, midsize, and\\nmicro, all computers share some basic elements, described in the next section.\\nElements of a Computer System\\nA computer is an electronic device capable of performing commands. The basic commands\\nthat a computer performs are input (get data), output (display result), storage, and perfor-\\nmance of arithmetic and logical operations.

Similarly, all\\ndata must be brought into main memory before a program can manipulate it. When the\\ncomputer is turned off, everything in main memory is lost.\\nMain memory is an ordered sequence of cells, called memory cells. Each cell has a\\nunique location in main memory, called the address of the cell. These addresses help\\nyou access the information stored in the cell.

Moreover, this figure shows the data as numbers and\\nletters. However, as explained later in this chapter, main memory stores everything as\\nsequences of 0s and 1s. The memory addresses are also expressed as sequences of 0s and 1s.\\nSECONDARY STORAGE\\nBecause programs and data must be loaded into the main memory before processing and\\nbecause everything in main memory is lost when the computer is turned off, information\\nstored in main memory must be saved in some other device for permanent storage. The device\\nthat stores information permanently (unless the device becomes unusable or you change the\\ninformation by rewriting it) is called secondary storage. To be able to transfer information\\nfrom main memory to secondary storage, these components must be directly connected to\\neach other. Examples of secondary storage are hard disks, flash drives, and CD-ROMs.\\nInput /Output Devices\\nFor a computer to perform a useful task, it must be able to take in data and programs and\\ndisplay the results of calculations. The devices that feed data and programs into computers\\nare called input devices. The keyboard, mouse, scanner, camera, and secondary storage are\\nexamples of input devices. The devices that the computer uses to display results are called\\noutput devices. A monitor, printer, and secondary storage are examples of output devices.\\nSoftware\\nSoftware are programs written to perform specific tasks. For example, word processors\\nare programs that you use to write letters, papers, and even books. All software is written\\nin programming languages. There are two types of programs: system programs and\\napplication programs.\\nSystem programs control the computer. The system program that loads first when you\\nturn on your computer is called the operating system. Without an operating system, the\\ncomputer is useless. The operating system handles the overall activity of the computer\\nand provides services. Some of these services include memory management, input/output\\nactivities, and storage management. The operating system has a special program that\\norganizes secondary storage so that you can conveniently access information. Some\\nwell-known operating systems are Windows 8, Mac OS X, Linux, and Android.\\nApplication programs perform a specific task. Word processors, spreadsheets, and\\ngames are examples of application programs. The operating system is the program that\\nruns application programs.\\nThe Language of a Computer\\nWhen you press A on your keyboard, the computer displays A on the screen. But what is\\nactually stored inside the computer’s main memory? What is the language of the computer?\\nHow does it store whatever you type on the keyboard?\\nThe Language of a Computer\\n|\\n5\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Electrical signals are used inside the\\ncomputer to process information. There are two types of electrical signals: analog and\\ndigital. Analog signals are continuously varying\\ncontinuous wave forms used to\\nrepresent such things as sound. Audio tapes, for example, store data in analog signals.\\nDigital signals represent information with a sequence of 0s and 1s. A 0 represents a low\\nvoltage, and a 1 represents a high voltage. Digital signals are more reliable carriers of\\ninformation than analog signals and can be copied from one device to another with exact\\nprecision. You might have noticed that when you make a copy of an audio tape, the\\nsound quality of the copy is not as good as the original tape. On the other hand, when\\nyou copy a CD, the copy is the same as the original. Computers use digital signals.\\nBecause digital signals are processed inside a computer, the language of a computer, called\\nmachine language, is a sequence of 0s and 1s. The digit 0 or 1 is called a binary digit,\\nor bit. Sometimes a sequence of 0s and 1s is referred to as a binary code or a binary\\nnumber.\\nBit: A binary digit 0 or 1.\\nA sequence of eight bits is called a byte.

The most commonly used\\nencoding scheme on personal computers is the seven-bit American Standard Code\\nfor Information Interchange (ASCII). The ASCII data set consists of 128 characters\\nnumbered 0 through 127. That is, in the ASCII data set, the position of the first character\\nis 0, the position of the second character is 1, and so on. In this scheme, A is encoded as\\nthe binary number 1000001. In fact, A is the 66th character in the ASCII character code,\\nbut its position is 65 because the position of the first character is 0. Furthermore, the\\nbinary number 1000001 is the binary representation of 65. The character 3 is encoded as\\n0110011. Note that in the ASCII character set, the position of the character 3 is 51, so\\nthe character 3 is the 52nd character in the ASCII set. It also follows that 0110011 is the\\nbinary representation of 51. For a complete list of the printable ASCII character set, refer\\nto Appendix C.\\nThe number system that we use in our daily life is called the decimal system, or base 10.\\nBecause everything inside a computer is represented as a sequence of 0s and 1s, that is,\\nbinary numbers, the number system that a computer uses is called binary, or base 2. We\\nindicated in the preceding paragraph that the number 1000001 is the binary representation\\nof 65. Appendix E describes how to convert a number from base 10 to base 2 and vice versa.\\nInside the computer, every character is represented as a sequence of eight bits, that is, as a byte.\\nNow the eight-bit binary representation of 65 is 01000001. Note that we added 0 to the left\\nof the seven-bit representation of 65 to convert it to an eight-bit representation. Similarly,\\nwe add one 0 to the binary value of 51 to get its eight-bit binary representation 00110011.\\nASCII is a seven-bit code. Therefore, to represent each ASCII character inside the\\ncomputer, you must convert the seven-bit binary representation of an ASCII character\\nto an eight-bit binary representation. This is accomplished by adding 0 to the left of the\\nseven-bit ASCII encoding of a character. Hence, inside the computer, the character\\nA is represented as 01000001, and the character 3 is represented as 00110011.\\nThere are other encoding schemes, such as EBCDIC (used by IBM) and Unicode, which\\nis a more recent development. EBCDIC consists of 256 characters; Unicode consists of\\n65,536 characters. To store a character belonging to Unicode, you need 16 bits or\\ntwo bytes. Unicode was created to represent a variety of characters and is continuously\\nexpanding. It consists of characters from languages other than English.\\nThe Evolution of Programming Languages\\nThe most basic language of a computer, the machine language, provides program\\ninstructions in bits. Even though most computers perform the same kinds of operations,\\nthe designers of the computer may have chosen different sets of binary codes to perform\\nthe operations. Therefore, the machine language of one machine is not necessarily the\\nsame as the machine language of another machine. The only consistency among com-\\nputers is that in any modern computer, all data is stored and manipulated as binary codes.\\n1\\nThe Evolution of Programming Languages\\n|\\n7\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

Even though we have not yet introduced the syntax\\nof C++, to illustrate how to write a C++ code corresponding to the steps of your solution, let\\nus consider the algorithm designed in Example 1-1.

Each\\nsubproblem is then analyzed, and a solution is obtained to solve the subproblem.\\nThe solutions to all of the subproblems are then combined to solve the overall problem.\\nThis process of implementing a structured design is called structured programming.\\nThe structured-design approach is also known as top-down design, bottom-up\\ndesign, stepwise refinement, and modular programming.\\nObject-Oriented Programming\\nObject-oriented design (OOD) is a widely used programming methodology. In OOD,\\nthe first step in the problem-solving process is to identify the components called objects,\\nwhich form the basis of the solution, and to determine how these objects interact with one\\nanother. For example, suppose you want to write a program that automates the video\\nrental process for a local video store. The two main objects in this problem are the video\\nand the customer.\\nAfter identifying the objects, the next step is to specify for each object the relevant data\\nand possible operations to be performed on that data. For example, for a video object, the\\ndata might include:\\n•\\nmovie name\\n•\\nyear released\\n•\\nproducer\\n•\\nproduction company\\n•\\nnumber of copies in stock\\nSome of the operations on a video object might include:\\n•\\nchecking the name of the movie\\n•\\nreducing the number of copies in stock by one after a copy is rented\\n•\\nincrementing the number of copies in stock by one after a customer returns a\\nparticular video\\nThis illustrates that each object consists of data and operations on that data. An object\\ncombines data and operations on the data into a single unit. In OOD, the final program is\\na collection of interacting objects. A programming language that implements OOD is\\ncalled an object-oriented programming (OOP) language. You will learn about the\\nmany advantages of OOD in later chapters.\\n20\\n|\\nChapter 1: An Overview of Computers and Programming Languages\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

In Chapter 2, you will learn the basic\\ndata types of C++ and discover how to represent and manipulate data in computer\\nmemory. Chapter 3 discusses how to input data into a C++ program and output the\\nresults generated by a C++ program.\\nTo create operations, you write algorithms and implement them in a programming\\nlanguage. Because a data element in a complex program usually has many operations, to\\nseparate operations from each other and to use them effectively and in a convenient\\nmanner, you use functions to implement algorithms. After a brief introduction in\\nChapters 2 and 3, you will learn the details of functions in Chapter 6. Certain algorithms\\nrequire that a program make decisions, a process called selection. Other algorithms might\\nrequire certain statements to be repeated until certain conditions are met, a process called\\nrepetition. Still other algorithms might require both selection and repetition. You will learn\\nabout selection and repetition mechanisms, called control structures, in Chapters 4 and 5.\\nAlso, in Chapter 8, using a mechanism called an array, you will learn how to manipulate\\ndata when data items are of the same type, such as items in a list of sales figures.\\nFinally, to work with objects, you need to know how to combine data and operations on\\nthe data into a single unit. In C++, the mechanism that allows you to combine data and\\noperations on the data into a single unit is called a class. You will learn how classes work,\\nhow to work with classes, and how to create classes in the chapter Classes and Data\\nAbstraction (later in this book).\\nAs you can see, you need to learn quite a few things before working with the OOD\\nmethodology.\\nTo\\nmake\\nthis\\nlearning\\neasier\\nand\\nmore\\neffective,\\nthis\\nbook\\npurposely divides control structures into two chapters (Chapter 4—selection; Chapter 5—\\nrepetition).\\nFor some problems, the structured approach to program design will be very effective.\\nOther problems will be better addressed by OOD. For example, if a problem requires\\nmanipulating sets of numbers with mathematical functions, you might use the structured\\ndesign approach and outline the steps required to obtain the solution. The C++ library\\nsupplies a wealth of functions that you can use effectively to manipulate numbers. On the\\nother hand, if you want to write a program that would make a candy machine opera-\\ntional, the OOD approach is more effective. C++ was designed especially to implement\\nOOD. Furthermore, OOD works well with structured design.\\nBoth the structured design and OOD approaches require that you master the basic\\ncomponents of a programming language to be an effective programmer. In Chapters 2\\nto 8, you will learn the basic components of C++, such as data types, input/output,\\ncontrol structures, user-defined functions, and arrays, required by either type of pro-\\ngramming. We develop and illustrate how these concepts work using the structured\\nprogramming approach. Starting with the chapter Classes and Data Abstraction, we\\ndevelop and use the OOD approach.\\n1\\nProgramming Methodologies\\n|\\n21\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

From the early 1980s through the early 1990s,\\nseveral C++ compilers were available. Even though the fundamental features of C++ in\\nall compilers were mostly the same, the C++ language, referred to in this book as\\nStandard C++, was evolving in slightly different ways in different compilers. As a\\nconsequence, C++ programs were not always portable from one compiler to another.\\nTo address this problem, in the early 1990s, a joint committee of the American National\\nStandards Institute (ANSI) and International Organization for Standardization (ISO) was\\nestablished to standardize the syntax of C++. In mid-1998, ANSI/ISO C++ language\\nstandards were approved. Most of today’s compilers comply with these new standards.\\nOver the last several years, the C++ committee met several times to further standardize\\nthe syntax of C++. In 2011, the second standard of C++ was approved. The main\\nobjective of this standard, referred to as C++11, is to make the C++ code cleaner and\\nmore effective. For example, the new standard introduces the data type long long to deal\\nwith large integers, auto declaration of variables using initialization statements, enhancing\\nthe functionality of for loops to effectively work with arrays and containers, and new\\nalgorithms. Some of these new C++ features are introduced in this book.\\nThis book focuses on the syntax of C++ as approved by ANSI/ISO, referred to as ANSI/\\nISO Standard C++.\\nQUICK REVIEW\\n1.\\nA computer is an electronic device capable of performing arithmetic and\\nlogical operations.\\n2.\\nA computer system has two components: hardware and software.\\n3.\\nThe central processing unit (CPU) and the main memory are examples of\\nhardware components.\\n4.\\nAll programs must be brought into main memory before they can be executed.\\n5.\\nWhen the power is switched off, everything in main memory is lost.\\n6.\\nSecondary storage provides permanent storage for information.

As your objective is to learn the C++\\nprogramming language, two questions naturally arise. First, what is a computer program?\\nSecond, what is programming? A computer program, or a program, is a sequence of\\nstatements whose objective is to accomplish a task. Programming is a process of\\nplanning and creating a program. These two definitions tell the truth, but not the whole\\ntruth, about programming. It may very well take an entire book to give a good and\\nsatisfactory definition of programming. You might gain a better grasp of the nature of\\nprogramming from an analogy, so let us turn to a topic about which almost everyone has\\nsome knowledge—cooking. A recipe is also a program, and everyone with some cooking\\nexperience can agree on the following:\\n1.\\nIt is usually easier to follow a recipe than to create one.\\n2.\\nThere are good recipes and there are bad recipes.\\n3.\\nSome recipes are easy to follow and some are not easy to follow.\\n4.\\nSome recipes produce reliable results and some do not.\\n5.\\nYou must have some knowledge of how to use cooking tools to follow\\na recipe to completion.\\n6.\\nTo create good new recipes, you must have a lot of knowledge and a\\ngood understanding of cooking.\\nThese same six points are also true about programming. Let us take the cooking analogy\\none step further. Suppose you need to teach someone how to become a chef. How\\nwould you go about it? Would you first introduce the person to good food, hoping that a\\ntaste for good food develops? Would you have the person follow recipe after recipe in the\\nhope that some of it rubs off? Or would you first teach the use of tools and the nature of\\ningredients, the foods and spices, and explain how they fit together? Just as there is\\ndisagreement about how to teach cooking, there is disagreement about how to teach\\nprogramming.\\nLearning a programming language is like learning to become a chef or learning to\\nplay a musical instrument. All three require direct interaction with the tools.\\nYou cannot become a good chef just by reading recipes. Similarly, you cannot become\\na musician by reading books about musical instruments. The same is true of\\nprogramming. You must have a fundamental knowledge of the language, and you must\\ntest your programs on the computer to make sure that each program does what it is\\nsupposed to do.\\nA Quick Look at a C++ Program\\nIn this chapter, you will learn the basic elements and concepts of the C++ programming\\nlanguage to create C++ programs. In addition to giving examples to illustrate various\\nconcepts, we will also show C++ programs to clarify these concepts.

Therefore, we introduce this term in this section. Recall from\\nChapter 1 that all data must be loaded into main memory before it can be manipulated.\\nFor example, given the length and width, the program in Figure 2-1 computes and\\noutputs the area and perimeter of a rectangle. This means that the values of length and\\nwidth must be stored in main memory. Also, recall from Chapter 1 that main memory is\\nan ordered sequence of cells and every cell has an address. Inside the computer, the\\naddress of a memory cell is in binary. Once we store the values of length and width, and\\nbecause these values might be needed in more than one place in a program, we would\\nlike to know the locations where these values are stored and how to access those memory\\nlocations. C++ makes it easy for a programmer to specify the locations because the\\nprogrammer can supply an alphabetic name for each of those locations. Of course, we\\nmust follow the rules to specify the names. For example, in the program in Figure 2-1,\\nwe are telling the system to allocate four memory spaces and name them length, width,\\narea, and perimeter, respectively. (We will explain the meaning of the word double,\\nshown in blue later in this chapter.) Essentially, a variable is a memory location whose\\ncontents can be changed. So length, width, area, and perimeter are variables.

In general, a C++ program is a collection of one or more\\nsubprograms, called functions. Roughly speaking, a subprogram or a function is a\\ncollection of statements, and when it is activated, or executed, it accomplishes something.\\nSome functions, called predefined or standard functions, are already written and are\\nprovided as part of the system. But to accomplish most tasks, programmers must learn to\\nwrite their own functions.\\nEvery C++ program has a function called main. Thus, if a C++ program has only\\none function, it must be the function main. Until Chapter 6, other than using some\\nof the predefined functions, you will mainly deal with the function main. By the end\\nof this chapter, you will have learned how to write programs consisting only of the\\nfunction main.\\nIf you have never seen a program written in a programming language, the C++ program in\\nExample 2-1 may look like a foreign language. To make meaningful sentences in a foreign\\nlanguage, you must learn its alphabet, words, and grammar. The same is true of a program-\\nming language. To write meaningful programs, you must learn the programming language’s\\nspecial symbols, words, and syntax rules. The syntax rules tell you which statements\\n(instructions) are legal or valid, that is, which are accepted by the programming language\\nand which are not. You must also learn semantic rules, which determine the meaning of\\nthe instructions. The programming language’s rules, symbols, and special words enable you\\nto write programs to solve problems.\\nProgramming language: A set of rules, symbols, and special words.\\nIn the remainder of this section, you will learn about some of the special symbols of a\\nC++ program. Additional special symbols are introduced as other concepts are encoun-\\ntered in later chapters. Similarly, syntax and semantic rules are introduced and discussed\\nthroughout the book.\\nComments\\nThe program that you write should be clear not only to you, but also to the reader of\\nyour program. Part of good programming is the inclusion of comments in the program.\\nTypically, comments can be used to identify the authors of the program, give the date\\nwhen the program is written or modified, give a brief explanation of the program, and\\nexplain the meaning of key statements in a program. In the programming examples, for\\nthe programs that we write, we will not include the date when the program is written,\\nconsistent with the standard convention for writing such books.\\nComments are for the reader, not for the compiler. So when a compiler compiles a\\nprogram to check for the syntax errors, it completely ignores comments. Throughout this\\nbook, comments are shown in green.\\n34\\n|\\nChapter 2: Basic Elements of C++\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Similarly, a program designed to alphabetize a class list will manipulate names. You\\nwouldn’t use a cherry pie recipe to help you bake cookies. Similarly, you wouldn’t use a\\nprogram designed to perform arithmetic calculations to manipulate alphabetic characters.\\nFurthermore, you wouldn’t multiply or subtract names. Reflecting these kinds of underlying\\ndifferences, C++ categorizes data into different types, and only certain operations can be\\nperformed on particular types of data. Although at first it may seem confusing, by being so\\ntype conscious, C++ has built-in checks to guard against errors.\\nData type: A set of values together with a set of allowed operations.\\nC++ data types fall into the following three categories:\\n•\\nSimple data type\\n•\\nStructured data type\\n•\\nPointers\\nFor the next few chapters, you will be concerned only with simple data types.\\nSimple Data Types\\nThe simple data type is the fundamental data type in C++ because it becomes a building\\nblock for the structured data type, which you will start learning about in Chapter 8.\\nThere are three categories of simple data:\\n•\\nIntegral, which is a data type that deals with integers, or numbers\\nwithout a decimal part\\n•\\nFloating-point, which is a data type that deals with decimal numbers\\n•\\nEnumeration, which is a user-defined data type\\nThe enumeration type is C++’s method for allowing programmers to create their own\\nsimple data types. This data type will be discussed in Chapter 7.\\nIntegral data types are further classified into the following categories: char, short, int,\\nlong, bool, unsigned char, unsigned short, unsigned int, unsigned long,\\nlong long, and unsigned long long.\\nWhy are there so many categories of the same data type? Every data type has a different set of\\nvaluesassociatedwithit.Forexample,the chardatatypeisusedtorepresentintegersbetween–\\n128 and 127. The int data type is used to represent integers between –2147483648 and\\n2147483647, and the data type short is used to represent integers between –32768 and 32767.\\n38\\n|\\nChapter 2: Basic Elements of C++\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

As a result, programmers had to optimize the use of memory. Because writing a\\nprogram and making it work is already a complicated process, not having to worry about\\nthe size of memory makes for one less thing to think about. To effectively use memory, a\\nprogrammer can look at the type of data to be used by a program and thereby figure out\\nwhich data type to use. (Memory constraints may still be a concern for programs written\\nfor applications such as a wristwatch.)\\nTable 2-2 gives the range of possible values associated with some integral data types and\\nthe size of memory allocated to manipulate these values.\\nUse this table only as a guide. Different compilers may allow different ranges\\nof values. Check your compiler’s documentation. To find the exact size of the\\nintegral data types on a particular system, you can run a program given in\\nAppendix G (Memory Size of a System). Furthermore, to find the maximum\\nand minimum values of these data types, you can run another program given\\nin Appendix F (Header File climits). Also, the data type long long is\\navailable in C++11.\\nint DATA TYPE\\nThis section describes the int data type.

Recall that in C++, commas\\nare used to separate items in a list. So 36,782 would be interpreted as\\ntwo integers: 36 and 782.\\nbool DATA TYPE\\nThe data type bool has only two values: true and false. Also, true and false are called\\nthe logical (Boolean) values. The central purpose of this data type is to manipulate logical\\n(Boolean) expressions. Logical (Boolean) expressions will be formally defined and discussed\\nin detail in Chapter 4. In C++, bool, true, and false are reserved words.\\nchar DATA TYPE\\nThe data type char is mainly used to represent single characters—that is, letters, digits,\\nand special symbols. Thus, the char data type can represent every key on your keyboard.\\nWhen using the char data type, you enclose each character represented within single\\nquotation marks. Examples of values belonging to the char data type include the\\nfollowing:\\n'A', 'a', '0', '*', '+', '$', '&', ' '\\nNote that a blank space is a character and is written as ' ', with a space between the single\\nquotation marks.\\nThe data type char allows only one symbol to be placed between the single quotation\\nmarks. Thus, the value 'abc' is not of the type char. Furthermore, even though '!='and\\nsimilar special symbols are considered to be one symbol, they are not regarded as possible\\nvalues of the data type char. All the individual symbols located on the keyboard that are\\nprintable may be considered as possible values of the char data type.\\nSeveral different character data sets are currently in use. The most common are the\\nAmerican Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) and Extended Binary-\\nCoded Decimal Interchange Code (EBCDIC). The ASCII character set has 128 values.\\nThe EBCDIC character set has 256 values and was created by IBM. Both character sets\\nare described in Appendix C.\\nEach of the 128 values of the ASCII character set represents a different character. For\\nexample, the value 65 represents 'A', and the value 43 represents '+'. Thus, each\\ncharacter has a predefined ordering represented by the numeric value associated with\\nthe character. This ordering is called a collating sequence, in the set. The collating\\nsequence is used when you compare characters. For example, the value representing 'B'\\nis 66, so 'A' is smaller than 'B'. Similarly, '+' is smaller than 'A' because 43 is smaller\\nthan 65.\\nThe 14th character in the ASCII character set is called the newline character and is\\nrepresented as '\\\\n'.

Furthermore, the first 32 characters in the\\nASCII character set are nonprintable. (See Appendix C for a description of these\\ncharacters.)\\nFloating-Point Data Types\\nTo deal with decimal numbers, C++ provides the floating-point data type, which we\\ndiscuss in this section. To facilitate the discussion, let us review a concept from a high\\nschool or college algebra course.\\nYou may be familiar with scientific notation. For example:\\n43872918 = 4.3872918 * 107\\n{ 10 to the power of seven}\\n.0000265 = 2.65 * 10-5\\n{ 10 to the power of minus five}\\n47.9832 = 4.79832 * 101\\n{ 10 to the power of one}\\nTo represent decimal numbers, C++ uses a form of scientific notation called floating-\\npoint notation. Table 2-3 shows how C++ might print a set of decimal numbers using\\none machine’s interpretation of floating-point notation. In the C++ floating-point\\nnotation, the letter E stands for the exponent.\\nC++ provides three data types to manipulate decimal numbers: float, double, and\\nlong double. As in the case of integral data types, the data types float, double, and\\nlong double differ in the set of values it can represent.\\nOn most newer compilers, the data types double and long double are the same.\\nTherefore, only the data types float and double are described here.\\n2\\nTABLE 2-3\\nExamples of Decimal Numbers in Scientific and C++ Floating-Point Notations\\nDecimal Number\\nScientific Notation\\nC++ Floating-Point Notation\\n75.924\\n7.5924 * 101\\n7.592400E1\\n0.18\\n1.8 * 10-1\\n1.800000E-1\\n0.0000453\\n4.53 * 10-5\\n4.530000E-5\\n-1.482\\n-1.482 * 100\\n-1.482000E0\\n7800.0\\n7.8 * 103\\n7.800000E3\\nData Types\\n|\\n41\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

As before, when\\noperators have the same precedence, the expression is evaluated from left to right. You\\ncan always use parentheses to group operands and operators to avoid confusion.\\nNext, we discuss mixed expressions.\\nMixed Expressions\\nAn expression that has operands of different data types is called a mixed expression. A\\nmixed expression contains both integers and floating-point numbers. The following\\nexpressions are examples of mixed expressions:\\n2 + 3.5\\n6 / 4 + 3.9\\n5.4 * 2 - 13.6 + 18 / 2\\nIn the first expression, the operand + has one integer operand and one floating-point\\noperand. In the second expression, both operands for the operator / are integers, the first\\noperand of + is the result of 6 / 4, and the second operand of + is a floating-point\\nnumber. The third example is an even more complicated mix of integers and floating-\\npoint numbers. The obvious question is: How does C++ evaluate mixed expressions?\\nTwo rules apply when evaluating a mixed expression:\\n1.\\nWhen evaluating an operator in a mixed expression:\\na.\\nIf the operator has the same types of operands (that is, either both\\nintegers or both floating-point numbers), the operator is evaluated\\naccording to the type of the operands. Integer operands thus yield an\\ninteger result; floating-point numbers yield a floating-point number.\\nb.\\nIf the operator has both types of operands (that is, one is an integer and\\nthe other is a floating-point number), then during calculation, the\\ninteger is changed to a floating-point number with the decimal part of\\nzeroandtheoperatorisevaluated.Theresultisafloating-pointnumber.\\n2.\\nThe entire expression is evaluated according to the precedence rules;\\nthe multiplication, division, and modulus operators are evaluated\\nbefore the addition and subtraction operators. Operators having the\\nsame level of precedence are evaluated from left to right. Grouping\\nusing parentheses is allowed for clarity.\\nFrom these rules, it follows that when evaluating a mixed expression, you concentrate on\\none operator at a time, using the rules of precedence. If the operator to be evaluated has\\noperands of the same data type, evaluate the operator using Rule 1(a). That is, an operator\\nwith integer operands will yield an integer result, and an operator with floating-point\\noperands will yield a floating-point result. If the operator to be evaluated has one integer\\noperand and one floating-point operand, before evaluating this operator, convert the\\ninteger operand to a floating-point number with the decimal part of 0.

Later in this chapter,\\nyou will learn how to save the value of an expression and use it in subsequent calculations.\\nBefore leaving the discussion of data types, let us discuss one more data type—string.\\nstring Type\\nThe data type string is a programmer-defined data type. It is not directly available for\\nuse in a program like the simple data types discussed earlier. To use this data type, you\\nneed to access program components from the library, which will be discussed later in this\\nchapter. The data type string is a feature of ANSI/ISO Standard C++.\\nPrior to the ANSI/ISO C++ language standard, the standard C++ library did not provide a\\nstring data type. Compiler vendors often supplied their own programmer-defined string\\ntype, and the syntax and semantics of string operations often varied from vendor to vendor.\\nA string is a sequence of zero or more characters. Strings in C++ are enclosed in double\\nquotation marks. A string containing no characters is called a null or empty string. The\\nfollowing are examples of strings. Note that \"\" is the empty string.\\n\"William Jacob\"\\n\"Mickey\"\\n\"\"\\nEvery character in a string has a relative position in the string. The position of the first\\ncharacter is 0, the position of the second character is 1, and so on. The length of a string is\\nthe number of characters in it. When determining the length of a string, you must also\\ncount any spaces in the string.\\nstring Type\\n|\\n53\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

For example, the conversion\\nformula that converts inches into centimeters is fixed, because 1 inch is always equal to\\n2.54 centimeters. When stored in memory, this type of data needs to be protected from\\naccidental changes during program execution. In C++, you can use a named constant\\nto instruct a program to mark those memory locations in which data is fixed throughout\\nprogram execution.\\nNamed constant: A memory location whose content is not allowed to change during\\nprogram execution.\\nTo allocate memory, we use C++’s declaration statements. The syntax to declare a\\nnamed constant is:\\nconst dataType identifier = value;\\nIn C++, const is a reserved word. It should be noted that a named constant is initialized\\nand declared all in one statement and that it must be initialized when it is declared because\\nfrom this statement on the compiler will reject any attempt to change the value.\\nEXAMPLE 2-11\\nConsider the following C++ statements:\\nconst double CONVERSION = 2.54;\\nconst int NO_OF_STUDENTS = 20;\\nconst char BLANK = ' ';\\nThe first statement tells the compiler to allocate memory (eight bytes) to store a value\\nof type double, call this memory space CONVERSION, and store the value 2.54 in it.\\nThroughout a program that uses this statement, whenever the conversion formula is\\nneeded, the memory space CONVERSION can be accessed. The meaning of the other\\nstatements is similar.\\nNote that the identifier for a named constant is in uppercase letters. Even though\\nthere are no written rules, C++ programmers typically prefer to use uppercase letters\\nto name a named constant. Moreover, if the name of a named constant is a combina-\\ntion of more than one word, called a run-together word, then the words are typically\\nseparated\\nusing\\nan\\nunderscore.\\nFor\\nexample,\\nin\\nthe\\npreceding\\nexample,\\nNO_OF_STUDENTS is a run-together word.

Notice that 2.54f says that it is\\na float value. Recall that the memory size for float values is four bytes; for double\\nvalues, eight bytes. Because memory size is of little concern these days, as indicated earlier,\\nwe will mostly use the type double to work with floating-point values.\\nUsing a named constant to store fixed data, rather than using the data value itself, has\\none major advantage. If the fixed data changes, you do not need to edit the entire\\nprogram and change the old value to the new value wherever the old value is used.\\n(For example, in the program that computes the sales tax, the sales tax rate may\\nchange.) Instead, you can make the change at just one place, recompile the program,\\nand execute it using the new value throughout.

The fifth statement tells\\nthe compiler to allocate memory space and call it name.\\nAs in the case of naming named constants, there are no written rules for naming variables.\\nHowever, C++ programmers typically use lowercase letters to declare variables.

You also learned\\nthat after declaring a variable, you can use an assignment statement to initialize it. It is\\npossible to initialize and declare variables at the same time. Before we discuss how to\\nuse an input (read) statement, we address this important issue.\\nDeclaring and Initializing Variables\\nWhen a variable is declared, C++ may not automatically put a meaningful value in it. In\\nother words, C++ may not automatically initialize variables. For example, the int and\\ndouble variables may not be initialized to 0, as happens in some programming languages.\\nThis does not mean, however, that there is no value in a variable after its declaration.\\nWhen a variable is declared, memory is allocated for it.\\nRecall from Chapter 1 that main memory is an ordered sequence of cells, and each cell is\\ncapable of storing a value. Also, recall that the machine language is a sequence of 0s and\\n1s, or bits. Therefore, data in a memory cell is a sequence of bits. These bits are nothing\\nbut electrical signals, so when the computer is turned on, some of the bits are 1 and some\\nare 0. The state of these bits depends on how the system functions. However, when you\\ninstruct the computer to store a particular value in a memory cell, the bits are set\\naccording to the data being stored.\\nDuring data manipulation, the computer takes the value stored in particular cells and\\nperforms a calculation. If you declare a variable and do not store a value in it, the memory\\ncell still has a value—usually the value of the setting of the bits from their last use—and\\nyou have no way to know what this value is.\\nIf you only declare a variable and do not instruct the computer to put data into the variable,\\nthe value of that variable is garbage. However, the computer does not warn us, regards\\nwhatever values are in memory as legitimate, and performs calculations using those values\\nin memory. Using a variable in an expression without initializing it produces erroneous\\nresults. To avoid these pitfalls, C++ allows you to initialize variables while they are being\\ndeclared. For example, consider the following C++ statements in which variables are first\\ndeclared and then initialized:\\nint first, second;\\nchar ch;\\ndouble x;\\nfirst = 13;\\nsecond = 10;\\nch = ' ';\\nx = 12.6;\\nYou can declare and initialize these variables at the same time using the following C++\\nstatements:\\n62\\n|\\nChapter 2: Basic Elements of C++\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

The meaning of the other statements is similar.\\nIn reality, not all variables are initialized during declaration. It is the nature of the program\\nor the programmer’s choice that dictates which variables should be initialized during\\ndeclaration. The key point is that all variables must be initialized before they are used.\\nInput (Read) Statement\\nPreviously, you learned how to put data into variables using the assignment statement. In\\nthis section, you will learn how to put data into variables from the standard input device,\\nusing C++’s input (or read) statements.\\nIn most cases, the standard input device is the keyboard.\\nWhen the computer gets the data from the keyboard, the user is said to be acting interactively.\\nPutting data into variables from the standard input device is accomplished via the use of\\ncin and the operator >>. The syntax of cin together with >> is:\\ncin >> variable >> variable ...;\\nThis is called an input (read) statement. In C++, >> is called the stream extraction\\noperator.\\nIn a syntax, the shading indicates the part of the definition that is optional. Furthermore,\\nthroughout this book, the syntax is enclosed in yellow boxes.\\nEXAMPLE 2-16\\nSuppose that miles is a variable of type double. Further suppose that the input is\\n73.65. Consider the following statement:\\ncin >> miles;\\nThis statement causes the computer to get the input, which is 73.65, from the standard\\ninput device and stores it in the variable miles.

These\\noperators are used frequently by C++ programmers and are useful programming tools.\\nSuppose count is an int variable. The statement:\\ncount = count + 1;\\nincrements the value of count by 1. To execute this assignment statement, the computer\\nfirst evaluates the expression on the right, which is count + 1. It then assigns this value to\\nthe variable on the left, which is count.\\nAs you will see in later chapters, such statements are frequently used to count how many\\ntimes certain things have happened. To expedite the execution of such statements, C++\\nprovides the increment operator, ++ (two plus signs), which increases the value of a\\nvariable by 1, and the decrement operator, –– (two minus signs), which decreases the\\nvalue of a variable by 1. Increment and decrement operators each have two forms, pre\\nand post. The syntax of the increment operator is:\\nPre-increment: ++variable\\nPost-increment: variable++\\nThe syntax of the decrement operator is:\\nPre-decrement: ––variable\\nPost-decrement: variable––\\nLet’s look at some examples. The statement:\\n++count;\\nor:\\ncount++;\\nincrements the value of count by 1. Similarly, the statement:\\n––count;\\nor:\\ncount––;\\ndecrements the value of count by 1.\\nBecause both the increment and decrement operators are built into C++, the value of the\\nvariable is quickly incremented or decremented without having to use the form of an\\nassignment statement.\\nNow, both the pre- and post-increment operators increment the value of the variable by 1.\\nSimilarly, the pre- and post-decrement operators decrement the value of the variable by 1.\\n70\\n|\\nChapter 2: Basic Elements of C++\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

The difference\\nbecomes apparent when the variable using these operators is employed in an expression.\\nSuppose that x is an int variable. If ++x is used in an expression, first the value of x is\\nincremented by 1, and then the new value of x is used to evaluate the expression. On the\\nother hand, if x++ is used in an expression, first the current value of x is used in the\\nexpression, and then the value of x is incremented by 1. The following example clarifies\\nthe difference between the pre- and post-increment operators.\\nSuppose that x and y are int variables. Consider the following statements:\\nx = 5;\\ny = ++x;\\nThe first statement assigns the value 5 to x. To evaluate the second statement, which uses\\nthe pre-increment operator, first the value of x is incremented to 6, and then this value, 6,\\nis assigned to y. After the second statement executes, both x and y have the value 6. The\\nequivalent results would occur with this set of statements:\\nx = 5;\\nx = x + 1;\\ny = x;\\nNow, consider the following statements:\\nx = 5;\\ny = x++;\\nAs before, the first statement assigns 5 to x. In the second statement, the post-increment\\noperator is applied to x. To execute the second statement, first the value of x, which is 5,\\nis used to evaluate the expression, and then the value of x is incremented to 6. Finally, the\\nvalue of the expression, which is 5, is stored in y. After the second statement executes,\\nthe value of x is 6, and the value of y is 5. The equivalent results would occur with this\\nset of statements:\\nx = 5;\\ny = x;\\nx = x + 1;\\nAs you see, the only difference between the pre- and post-increment statements is when\\nthe incrementing takes place: before the assignment or after.\\nThe following example further illustrates how the pre and post forms of the increment\\noperator work.\\nEXAMPLE 2-20\\nSuppose a and b are int variables and\\na = 5;\\nb = 2 + (++a);\\nIncrement and Decrement Operators\\n|\\n71\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

For example, the descriptions of the functions needed to perform\\ninput/output (I/O) are contained in the header file iostream. Similarly, the descriptions\\nof some very useful mathematical functions, such as power, absolute, and sine, are\\ncontained in the header file cmath. If you want to use I/O or math functions, you need\\nto tell the computer where to find the necessary code. You use preprocessor directives\\nand the names of header files to tell the computer the locations of the code provided in\\nlibraries.

To use a header file in a C++ program, use the\\npreprocessor directive include.\\nThe general syntax to include a header file (provided by the IDE) in a C++ program is:\\n#include <headerFileName>\\nFor example, the following statement includes the header file iostream in a C++ program:\\n#include <iostream>\\nPreprocessor directives to include header files are placed as the first line of a program so\\nthat the identifiers declared in those header files can be used throughout the program.\\n(Recall that in C++, identifiers must be declared before they can be used.)\\nCertain header files are provided as part of C++. Appendix F describes some of the\\ncommonly used header files.

All three components are integral parts of the C++ system. The program\\ndevelopment environment consists of the six steps shown in Figure 1-2.

For now, you need to know\\nonly how to use cin and cout and, in fact, any other identifier from the header file\\niostream.)\\nThere are several ways you can use an identifier declared in the namespace std.

The program contains statements that accomplish meaningful results. Taken\\ntogether, the preprocessor directives and the program statements constitute the C++\\nsource code.

Using the proper structure for a C++ program makes it easier\\nto understand and subsequently modify the program. There is nothing more frustrating\\nthan trying to follow and perhaps modify a program that is syntactically correct but has\\nno structure.\\nIn addition, every C++ program must satisfy certain rules of the language. A C++\\nprogram must contain the function main. It must also follow the syntax rules, which, like\\ngrammar rules, tell what is right and what is wrong and what is legal and what is illegal in\\nthe language. Other rules serve the purpose of giving precise meaning to the language;\\nthat is, they support the language’s semantics.\\nThe following sections are designed to help you learn how to use the C++ programming\\nelements you have learned so far to create a functioning program. These sections\\ncover the syntax; the use of blanks; the use of semicolons, brackets, and commas;\\nsemantics; naming identifiers; prompt lines; documentation, including comments; and\\nform and style.\\nSyntax\\nThe syntax rules of a language tell what is legal and what is not legal. Errors in syntax are\\ndetected during compilation. For example, consider the following C++ statements:\\nint x;\\n//Line 1\\nint y\\n//Line 2\\ndouble z;\\n//Line 3\\ny = w + x;\\n//Line 4\\nWhen these statements are compiled, a compilation error will occur at Line 2 because the\\nsemicolon is missing after the declaration of the variable y. A second compilation error\\nwill occur at Line 4 because the identifier w is used but has not been declared.\\nAs discussed in Chapter 1, you enter a program into the computer by using a text editor.\\nWhen the program is typed, errors are almost unavoidable. Therefore, when the program is\\ncompiled, you are most likely to see syntax errors. It is quite possible that a syntax error at a\\nparticular place might lead to syntax errors in several subsequent statements. It is very\\ncommon for the omission of a single character to cause four or five error messages.\\nHowever, when the first syntax error is removed and the program is recompiled, sub-\\nsequent syntax errors caused by this syntax error may disappear. Therefore, you should\\ncorrect syntax errors in the order in which the compiler lists them. As you become more\\nfamiliar and experienced with C++, you will learn how to quickly spot and fix syntax\\nerrors. Also, compilers not only discover syntax errors, but also hint and sometimes tell the\\nuser where the syntax errors are and how to fix them.\\n2\\nProgram Style and Form\\n|\\n89\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

The semicolon is also called a statement\\nterminator.\\nNote that curly braces, { and }, are not C++ statements in and of themselves, even\\nthough they often appear on a line with no other code. You might regard brackets as\\ndelimiters, because they enclose the body of a function and set it off from other parts of\\nthe program. Brackets have other uses, which will be explained in Chapter 4.\\nRecall that commas are used to separate items in a list. For example, you use commas\\nwhen you declare more than one variable following a data type.\\nSemantics\\nThe set of rules that gives meaning to a language is called semantics. For example, the\\norder-of-precedence rules for arithmetic operators are semantic rules.\\nIf a program contains syntax errors, the compiler will warn you. What happens when a\\nprogram contains semantic errors? It is quite possible to eradicate all syntax errors in a\\nprogram and still not have it run.

In using self-documenting identifiers, you may inadvertently include\\nrun-together words, which may lessen the clarity of your documentation. You can make\\nrun-together words easier to understand by either capitalizing the beginning of each new\\nword or by inserting an underscore just before a new word.

Then, you can\\nuse the conversion formula, 1 inch = 2.54 centimeters, to find the equivalent length\\nin centimeters. To convert the length from feet and inches to inches, you multiply\\nthe number of feet by 12, as 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, and add the given inches.\\nFor example, suppose the input is 5 feet and 7 inches. You then find the total inches\\nas follows:\\ntotalInches = (12 * feet) + inches\\n= 12 * 5 + 7\\n= 67\\nYou can then apply the conversion formula, 1 inch = 2.54 centimeters, to find the\\nlength in centimeters.\\ncentimeters = totalInches * 2.54\\n= 67 * 2.54\\n= 170.18\\nBased on this analysis of the problem, you can design an algorithm as follows:\\n1.\\nGet the length in feet and inches.\\n2.\\nConvert the length into total inches.\\n3.\\nConvert total inches into centimeters.\\n4.\\nOutput centimeters.\\nVariables The input for the program is two numbers: one for feet and one for inches. Thus,\\nyou need two variables: one to store feet and the other to store inches. Because the\\nprogram will first convert the given length into inches, you need another variable to\\nstore the total inches. You also need a variable to store the equivalent length in\\ncentimeters. In summary, you need the following variables:\\nint feet;\\n//variable to hold given feet\\nint inches;\\n//variable to hold given inches\\nint totalInches;\\n//variable to hold total inches\\ndouble centimeters;\\n//variable to hold length in centimeters\\nWatch\\nthe Video\\n96\\n|\\nChapter 2: Basic Elements of C++\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

Similarly, to find the total inches, you need to\\nmultiply the feet by 12 and add the inches. Instead of using 12 directly in the\\nprogram, you will also declare this value as a named constant.

Because the data will be entered from the\\nkeyboard and the output will be displayed on the screen, the program must include the\\nheader file iostream. Thus, the first statement of the program, after the comments as\\ndescribed above, will be the preprocessor directive to include this header file.\\nThis program requires two types of memory locations for data manipulation: named\\nconstants and variables.

To find the number of half-dollars, you divide\\n646 by 50, the value of a half-dollar, and find the quotient, which is 12, and the\\nremainder, which is 46. The quotient, 12, is the number of half-dollars, and the\\nremainder, 46, is the remaining change.\\nNext, divide the remaining change by 25 to find the number of quarters.

You used cin and\\nthe extraction operator >> to get data from the keyboard, and cout and the insertion\\noperator << to send output to the screen. Because I/O operations are fundamental to\\nany programming language, in this chapter, you will learn about C++’s I/O operations\\nin more detail. First, you will learn about statements that extract input from the\\nstandard input device and send output to the standard output device. You will then\\nlearn how to format output using manipulators. In addition, you will learn about the\\nlimitations of the I/O operations associated with the standard input/output devices and\\nlearn how to extend these operations to other devices.\\nI/O Streams and Standard I/O Devices\\nA program performs three basic operations: it gets data, it manipulates the data, and it\\noutputs the results. In Chapter 2, you learned how to manipulate numeric data using\\narithmetic operations. In later chapters, you will learn how to manipulate nonnumeric\\ndata. Because writing programs for I/O is quite complex, C++ offers extensive support\\nfor I/O operations by providing substantial prewritten I/O operations, some of which\\nyou encountered in Chapter 2. In this chapter, you will learn about various I/O\\noperations that can greatly enhance the flexibility of your programs.\\nIn C++, I/O is a sequence of bytes, called a stream, from the source to the\\ndestination. The bytes are usually characters, unless the program requires other\\ntypes of information, such as a graphic image or digital speech. Therefore, a\\nstream is a sequence of characters from the source to the destination. There are\\ntwo types of streams:\\nInput stream: A sequence of characters from an input device to the computer.\\nOutput stream: A sequence of characters from the computer to an output device.\\nRecall that the standard input device is usually the keyboard, and the standard\\noutput device is usually the screen. To receive data from the keyboard and send\\noutput to the screen, every C++ program must use the header file iostream. This\\nheader file contains, among other things, the definitions of two data types,\\nistream (input stream) and ostream (output stream). The header file also contains\\ntwo variable declarations, one for cin (pronounced ‘‘see-in’’), which stands for\\ncommon input, and one for cout (pronounced ‘‘see-out’’), which stands for\\ncommon output.\\nThese variable declarations are similar to the following C++ statements:\\nistream cin;\\nostream cout;\\nTo use cin and cout, every C++ program must use the preprocessor directive:\\n#include <iostream>\\n124\\n|\\nChapter 3: Input/Output\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

Without\\nthe statement using namespace std;, you refer to these identifiers as std::cin\\nand std::cout. In Chapter 7, you will learn about the meaning of the statement\\nusing namespace std; in detail.\\nVariables of type istream are called input stream variables; variables of type ostream\\nare called output stream variables. A stream variable is either an input stream\\nvariable or an output stream variable.\\nBecause cin and cout are already defined and have specific meanings, to avoid confu-\\nsion, you should never redefine them in programs.\\nThe variable cin has access to operators and functions that can be used to extract data\\nfrom the standard input device. You have briefly used the extraction operator >> to input\\ndata from the standard input device. The next section describes in detail how the\\nextraction operator >> works. In the following sections, you will learn how to use the\\nfunctions get, ignore, peek, and putback to input data in a specific manner.\\ncin and the Extraction Operator >>\\nIn Chapter 2, you saw how to input data from the standard input device by using cin and\\nthe extraction operator >>. Suppose payRate is a double variable. Consider the\\nfollowing C++ statement:\\ncin >> payRate;\\nWhen the computer executes this statement, it inputs the next number typed on\\nthe keyboard and stores this number in payRate. Therefore, if the user types 15.50, the\\nvalue stored in payRate is 15.50.\\nThe extraction operator >> is binary and thus takes two operands. The left-side operand\\nmust be an input stream variable, such as cin. Because the purpose of an input statement\\nis to read and store values in a memory location and because only variables refer to\\nmemory locations, the right-side operand is a variable.\\nThe extraction operator >> is defined only for putting data into variables of simple\\ndata types. Therefore, the right-side operand of the extraction operator >> is a variable\\nof the simple data type. However, C++ allows the programmer to extend the definition\\nof the extraction operator >> so that data can also be put into other types of variables\\nby using an input statement. You will learn this mechanism in Chapter 13 later in\\nthis book.\\nThe syntax of an input statement using cin and the extraction operator >> is:\\ncin >> variable >> variable...;\\nI/O Streams and Standard I/O Devices\\n|\\n125\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

C++ comes with a wealth of functions,\\ncalled predefined functions, that are already written. In this section, you will learn how\\nto use some predefined functions that are provided as part of the C++ system. Later in this\\nchapter, you will learn how to use stream functions to perform a specific I/O operation.\\nRecall from Chapter 2 that predefined functions are organized as a collection of libraries,\\ncalled header files. A particular header file may contain several functions. Therefore, to\\nuse a particular function, you need to know the name of the function and a few other\\nthings, which are described shortly.\\nA very useful function, pow, called the power function, can be used to calculate xy in a\\nprogram. That is, pow(x, y) = xy. For example, pow(2.0, 3.0) = 2.03.0 = 8.0 and\\npow(4.0, 0.5) = 4.00.5 =\\nﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ\\n4:0\\np\\n= 2.0. The numbers x and y that you use in the\\nfunction pow are called the arguments or parameters of the function pow. For\\nexample, in pow(2.0, 3.0), the parameters are 2.0 and 3.0.\\nAn expression such as pow(2.0, 3.0) is called a function call, which causes the code\\nattached to the predefined function pow to execute and, in this case, computes 2.03.0.\\nThe header file cmath contains the specification of the function pow.\\nTo use a predefined function in a program, you need to know the name of the header\\nfile containing the specification of the function and include that header file in the\\nprogram.\\nIn addition, you need to know the name of the function, the number of\\nparameters the function takes, and the type of each parameter. You must also be aware\\nof what the function is going to do. For example, to use the function pow, you must\\ninclude the header file cmath. The function pow has two parameters, which are decimal\\nnumbers. The function calculates the first parameter to the power of the second\\nparameter. (Appendix F describes some commonly used header files and predefined\\nfunctions.)\\nThe program in the following example illustrates how to use predefined functions in a\\nprogram. More specifically, we use some math functions, from the header file cmath, and\\nthe string function length, from the header file string. Note that the function\\nlength determines the length of a string.\\nEXAMPLE 3-4\\n//How to use predefined functions.\\n//This program uses the math functions pow and sqrt to determine\\n//and output the volume of a sphere, the distance between two\\n//points, respectively, and the string function length to find\\n//the number of characters in a string.\\n//If the radius of the sphere is r, then the volume of the sphere\\n//is (4/3)*PI*r^3. If (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) are the coordinates of two\\n//points in the X-Y plane, then the distance between these points is\\n//sqrt((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2).\\n#include <iostream>\\n#include <cmath>\\n#include <string>\\nUsing Predefined Functions in a Program\\n|\\n131\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

The output of Lines 11 and\\n13 demonstrates this functionality.\\nThe Dot Notation between I/O Stream Variables and I/O Functions:\\nA Precaution\\nIn the preceding sections, you learned how to manipulate an input stream to get data\\ninto a program. You also learned how to use the functions get, ignore, peek, and\\nputback. It is important that you use these functions exactly as shown. For example, to\\nuse the get function, you used statements such as the following:\\ncin.get(ch);\\nOmitting the dot—that is, the period between the variable cin and the function name\\nget—results in a syntax error. For example, in the statement:\\ncin.get(ch);\\ncin and get are two separate identifiers separated by a dot. In the statement:\\ncinget(ch);\\ncinget becomes a new identifier. If you used cinget(ch); in a program, the compiler\\nwould try to resolve an undeclared identifier, which would generate an error. Similarly,\\nmissing parentheses, as in cin.getch;, result in a syntax error. Also, remember that you\\nmust use the input functions together with an input stream variable. If you try to use any\\nof the input functions alone—that is, without the input stream variable—the compiler\\nmight generate an error message such as ‘‘undeclared identifier.’’ For example, the\\nstatement get(ch); could result in a syntax error.\\nAs you can see, several functions are associated with an istream variable, each doing a\\nspecific job. Recall that the functions get, ignore, and so on are members of the data type\\nistream. Called the dot notation, the dot separates the input stream variable name\\nfrom the member, or function, name. In fact, in C++, the dot is an operator called the\\nmember access operator.\\nC++ has a special name for the data types istream and ostream. The data types\\nistream and ostream are called classes. The variables cin and cout also have special\\nnames, called objects. Therefore, cin is called an istream object, and cout is called an\\nostream object. In fact, stream variables are called stream objects. You will learn these\\nconcepts in Chapter 11 later in this book.\\nUsing Predefined Functions in a Program\\n|\\n139\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

A program that is syntactically\\ncorrect might produce incorrect results.

For example, what would happen if you tried\\nto input a letter into an int variable? If the input data did not match the corresponding\\nvariables, the program would run into problems.

Consider the following\\nstatements:\\nint a, b, c;\\ndouble x;\\nIf the input is:\\nW 54\\nthen the statement:\\ncin >> a >> b;\\nwould result in an input failure, because you are trying to input the character 'W' into\\nthe int variable a.

Chapter 2 briefly introduced the process involved in\\ngenerating output on the standard output device. More precisely, you learned how to\\nuse the insertion operator << and the manipulator endl to display results on the standard\\noutput device.\\nHowever, there is a lot more to output than just displaying results. Sometimes, floating-\\npoint numbers must be output in a specific way. For example, a paycheck must be\\nprinted to two decimal places, whereas the results of a scientific experiment might\\nrequire the output of floating-point numbers to six, seven, or perhaps even ten decimal\\nplaces. Also, you might like to align the numbers in specific columns or fill the empty\\nspace between strings and numbers with a character other than the blank. For example,\\nin preparing the table of contents, the space between the section heading and the page\\nnumber might need to be filled with dots or dashes. In this section, you will learn about\\nvarious output functions and manipulators that allow you to format your output in a\\ndesired way.\\nRecall that the syntax of cout when used together with the insertion operator\\n<< is:\\ncout << expression or manipulator << expression or manipulator...;\\nHere, expression is evaluated, its value is printed, and manipulator is used to format\\nthe output. The simplest manipulator that you have used so far is endl, which is used to\\nmove the insertion point to the beginning of the next line.\\nOther output manipulators that are of interest include setprecision, fixed, showpoint,\\nand setw. The next few sections describe these manipulators.\\nsetprecision Manipulator\\nYou use the manipulator setprecision to control the output of floating-point num-\\nbers. Usually, the default output of floating-point numbers is scientific notation. Some\\nintegrated development environments (IDEs) might use a maximum of six decimal\\nplaces for the default output of floating-point numbers. However, when an employee’s\\npaycheck is printed, the desired output is a maximum of two decimal places. To print\\nfloating-point output to two decimal places, you use the setprecision manipulator to\\nset the precision to 2.\\nThe general syntax of the setprecision manipulator is:\\nsetprecision(n)\\nwhere n is the number of decimal places.\\n144\\n|\\nChapter 3: Input/Output\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

For example, to disable the mani-\\npulator fixed on the standard output device, you use the following statement:\\ncout.unsetf(ios::fixed);\\nAfter the manipulator fixed is disabled, the output of the floating-point numbers returns\\nto their default settings. The manipulator scientific is used to output floating-point\\nnumbers in scientific format.\\nOn some compilers, the statements cout << fixed; and cout << scientific;\\nmight not work. In this case, you can use cout.setf(ios::fixed); in place of\\ncout << fixed; and cout.setf(ios::scientific); in place of\\ncout << scientific;.\\nThe following example shows how the manipulators scientific and fixed work\\nwithout using the manipulator setprecision.\\nEXAMPLE 3-10\\n//Example: scientific and fixed\\n#include <iostream>\\nusing namespace std;\\n3\\nOutput and Formatting Output\\n|\\n145\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

The value of\\nradius printed in Line 16 contains a trailing 0. This is because the stored value of\\nradius has only two decimal places; a 0 is printed at the third decimal place. In a similar\\nmanner, the value of height is printed in Lines 12, 17, and 22.\\nAlso, notice how the statements in Lines 13, 18, and 23 calculate and output volume to\\ntwo, three, and four decimal places.\\nNote that the value of PI printed in Line 24 is rounded.\\nThe statement in Line 25 first sets the output of floating-point numbers to three decimal\\nplaces and then outputs the value of radius to three decimal places. After printing the\\nvalue of radius, the statement in Line 25 sets the output of floating-point numbers to\\ntwo decimal places and then outputs the value of height to two decimal places.

However, getting input\\nfrom the keyboard and sending output to the screen have several limitations. Inputting data in a\\nprogram from the keyboard is comfortable as long as the amount of input is very small. Sending\\noutput to the screen works well if the amount of data is small (no larger than the size of the\\nscreen) and you do not want to distribute the output in a printed format to others.\\nIf the amount of input data is large, however, it is inefficient to type it at the keyboard\\neach time you run a program. In addition to the inconvenience of typing large amounts\\nof data, typing can generate errors, and unintentional typos cause erroneous results. You\\nmust have some way to get data into the program from other sources. By using alternative\\nsources of data, you can prepare the data before running a program, and the program can\\naccess the data each time it runs.\\nSuppose you want to present the output of a program in a meeting. Distributing printed\\ncopies of the program output is a better approach than showing the output on a screen.\\nFor example, you might give a printed report to each member of a committee before an\\nimportant meeting. Furthermore, output must sometimes be saved so that the output\\nproduced by one program can be used as an input to other programs.\\nThis section discusses how to obtain data from other input devices, such as a disk (that is,\\nsecondary storage), and how to save the output to a disk. C++ allows a program to get\\ndata directly from and save output directly to secondary storage. A program can use the file\\nI/O and read data from or write data to a file. Formally, a file is defined as follows:\\nFile: An area in secondary storage used to hold information.\\nThe standard I/O header file, iostream, contains data types and variables that are used\\nonly for input from the standard input device and output to the standard output device.\\nIn addition, C++ provides a header file called fstream, which is used for file I/O.\\nAmong other things, the fstream header file contains the definitions of two data types:\\nifstream, which means input file stream and is similar to istream, and ofstream,\\nwhich means output file stream and is similar to ostream.\\n160\\n|\\nChapter 3: Input/Output\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

These same operators and\\nfunctions are also available for file I/O, but the header file fstream does not declare variables\\nto use them. You must declare variables called file stream variables, which include\\nifstream variables for input and ofstream variables for output.

This\\nstep is called opening the files. The stream member function open is used to open files.\\nThe syntax for opening a file is:\\nfileStreamVariable.open(sourceName);\\nHere, fileStreamVariable is a file stream variable, and sourceName is the name of the\\ninput/output file.\\nSuppose you include the declaration from Step 2 in a program. Further suppose that the input\\ndata is stored in a file called prog.dat. The following statements associate inData with\\nprog.dat and outData with prog.out. That is, the file prog.dat is opened for inputting\\ndata, and the file prog.out is opened for outputting data.\\ninData.open(\"prog.dat\");\\n//open the input file;\\nLine 1\\noutData.open(\"prog.out\"); //open the output file; Line 2\\n3\\nFile Input/Output\\n|\\n161\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

That is, first you\\ncreate a project, and then you add source files to the project. The statement in Line 1 assumes\\nthat the file prog.dat is in the same directory (subdirectory) as your project. However, if this\\nis in a different directory (subdirectory), then you must specify the path where the file is\\nlocated, along with the name of the file. For example, suppose that the file prog.dat is on a\\nflash memory in drive H. Then the statement in Line 1 should be modified as follows:\\ninData.open(\"h:\\\\\\\\prog.dat\");\\nNote that there are two \\\\ after h:. Recall from Chapter 2 that in C++, \\\\ is the escape\\ncharacter. Therefore, to produce a \\\\within a string, you need \\\\\\\\. (To be absolutely sure\\nabout specifying the source where the input file is stored, such as the drive h:\\\\\\\\, check\\nyour system’s documentation.)\\nSimilar conventions for the statement in Line 2.\\nSuppose that a program reads data from a file. Because different computers have drives\\nlabeled differently, for simplicity, throughout the book, we assume that the file containing\\nthe data and the program reading data from the file are in the same directory (subdirectory).\\nWe typically use .dat, .out, or .txt as an extension for the input and output files\\nand use Notepad, Wordpad, or TextPad to create and open these files. You can also use\\nyour IDE’s editor, if any, to create .txt (text) files. (To be absolutely sure about it, check\\nyou IDE’s documentation.)\\nStep 4 typically works as follows. You use the file stream variables with >>, <<, or other\\ninput/output functions. The syntax for using >> or << with file stream variables is exactly\\nthe same as the syntax for using cin and cout. Instead of using cin and cout, however,\\nyou use the file stream variable names that were declared. For example, the statement:\\ninData >> payRate;\\nreads the data from the file prog.dat and stores it in the variable payRate. The statement:\\noutData << \"The paycheck is: $\" << pay << endl;\\nstores the output—The paycheck is: $565.78—in the file prog.out. This statement\\nassumes that the pay was calculated as 565.78.\\nOnce the I/O is complete, Step 5 requires closing the files. Closing a file means that\\nthe file stream variables are disassociated from the storage area and are freed. Once\\nthese variables are freed, they can be reused for other file I/O. Moreover, closing an\\noutput file ensures that the entire output is sent to the file; that is, the buffer is\\nemptied. You close files by using the stream function close.

To calculate the gross amount, you multiply the number\\nof adult tickets sold by the price of an adult ticket, multiply the number of child tickets\\nsold by the price of a child ticket, and then add these two numbers. That is:\\ngrossAmount = adultTicketPrice * noOfAdultTicketsSold\\n+ childTicketPrice * noOfChildTicketsSold;\\nNext, you determine the percentage of the amount donated to the charity and then\\ncalculate the net sale amount by subtracting the amount donated from the gross\\namount. The formulas to calculate the amount donated and the net sale amount are\\ngiven below. This analysis leads to the following algorithm:\\n1.\\nGet the movie name.\\n2.\\nGet the price of an adult ticket.\\n3.\\nGet the price of a child ticket.\\n4.\\nGet the number of adult tickets sold.\\n5.\\nGet the number of child tickets sold.\\n6.\\nGet the percentage of the gross amount donated to the charity.\\n7.\\nCalculate the gross amount using the following formula:\\ngrossAmount = adultTicketPrice * noOfAdultTicketsSold\\n+ childTicketPrice * noOfChildTicketsSold;\\n8.\\nCalculate the amount donated to the charity using the following formula:\\namountDonated = grossAmount * percentDonation / 100;\\n9.\\nCalculate the net sale amount using the following formula:\\nnetSaleAmount = grossAmount – amountDonated;\\nVariables\\nFrom the preceding discussion, it follows that you need variables to store the\\nmovie name, adult ticket price, child ticket price, number of adult tickets sold,\\nnumber of child tickets sold, percentage of the gross amount donated to the\\ncharity, gross amount, amount donated, and net sale amount. Therefore, the\\nfollowing variables are needed:\\nstring movieName;\\ndouble adultTicketPrice;\\ndouble childTicketPrice;\\nint noOfAdultTicketsSold;\\nint noOfChildTicketsSold;\\ndouble percentDonation;\\ndouble grossAmount;\\ndouble amountDonated;\\ndouble netSaleAmount;\\nProgramming Example: Movie Tickets Sale and Donation to Charity\\n|\\n165\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

The program\\nshould output the student name, the five test scores, and the average test score.\\nOutput the average test score with two decimal places.\\nThe data to be read is stored in a file called test.txt. The output should be stored\\nin a file called testavg.out.\\nInput\\nA file containing the student name and the five test scores. A sample input is:\\nAndrew Miller 87.50 89 65.75 37 98.50\\nOutput\\nThe student name, the five test scores, and the average of the five test\\nscores, saved to a file.\\nPROBLEM\\nANALYSIS\\nAND\\nALGORITHM\\nDESIGN\\nTo find the average of the five test scores, you add the five test scores and divide the\\nsum by 5. The input data is in the following form: the student name followed by the\\nfive test scores. Therefore, you must read the student name first and then read the five\\ntest scores. This problem analysis translates into the following algorithm:\\n1.\\nRead the student name and the five test scores.\\n2.\\nOutput the student name and the five test scores.\\n3.\\nCalculate the average.\\n4.\\nOutput the average.\\nYou output the average test score in the fixed decimal format with two decimal places.\\nVariables The program needs to read a student’s first and last name and five test scores. Therefore, you\\nneed two variables to store the student name and five variables to store the five test scores.\\nTo find the average, you must add the five test scores and then divide the sum by 5.\\nThus, you need a variable to store the average test score. Furthermore, because the\\ninput data is in a file, you need an ifstream variable to open the input file. Because\\nthe program output will be stored in a file, you need an ofstream variable to open\\nthe output file. The program, therefore, needs at least the following variables:\\nifstream inFile;\\n//input file stream variable\\nofstream outFile;\\n//output file stream variable\\ndouble test1, test2, test3, test4, test5; //variables to\\n//read the five test scores\\ndouble average;\\n//variable to store the average test score\\nstring firstName;\\n//variable to store the first name\\nstring lastName;\\n//variable to store the last name\\nMAIN\\nALGORITHM\\nIn the preceding sections, we analyzed the problem and determined the formulas to\\nperform the calculations.

The programs you have examined so far were simple\\nand straightforward. To process a program, the computer begins at the first exe-\\ncutable statement and executes the statements in order until it comes to the end.\\nIn this chapter and Chapter 5, you will learn how to tell a computer that it does\\nnot have to follow a simple sequential order of statements; it can also make\\ndecisions and repeat certain statements over and over until certain conditions\\nare met.\\nControl Structures\\nA computer can process a program in one of the following ways: in sequence; selectively,\\nby making a choice, which is also called a branch; repetitively, by executing a statement\\nover and over, using a structure called a loop; or by calling a function. Figure 4-1\\nillustrates the first three types of program flow. (In Chapter 6, we will show how function\\ncalls work.) The programming examples in Chapters 2 and 3 included simple sequential\\nprograms. With such a program, the computer starts at the beginning and follows the\\nstatements in order to the end. No choices are made; there is no repetition. Control\\nstructures provide alternatives to sequential program execution and are used to alter the\\nsequential flow of execution. The two most common control structures are selection and\\nrepetition. In selection, the program executes particular statements depending on some\\ncondition(s). In repetition, the program repeats particular statements a certain number of\\ntimes based on some condition(s).\\nstatement1\\nstatement2\\nstatementN\\nstatement2\\nstatement1\\nfalse\\ntrue\\nexpression\\nstatement\\nfalse\\ntrue\\nexpression\\na.

Therefore, first we need to\\nlearn about logical expressions and how to evaluate them.\\nLogical expression: An expression that evaluates to true or false is called a logical\\nexpression.\\nFor example, because ‘‘8 is greater than 3’’ is true, the expression 8 > 3 is a logical\\nexpression. Note that > is an operator in C++, called the ‘‘greater than’’ and is an\\nexample of a relational operator. Table 4-1 lists the C++ relational operators.\\nIn C++, the symbol ==, which consists of two equal signs, is called the equality operator.\\nRecall that the symbol = is called the assignment operator. Remember that the equality\\noperator, ==, determines whether two expressions are equal, whereas the assignment\\noperator, =, assigns the value of an expression to a variable.\\nEach of the relational operators is a binary operator; that is, it requires two operands.\\nBecause the result of a comparison is true or false, expressions using these operators\\nalways evaluate to true or false.\\nRelational Operators and Simple Data Types\\nYou can use the relational operators with all three simple data types. In the following\\nexample, the expressions use both integers and real numbers:\\n4\\nTABLE 4-1\\nRelational Operators in C++\\nOperator\\nDescription\\n==\\nequal to\\n!=\\nnot equal to\\n<\\nless than\\n<=\\nless than or equal to\\n>\\ngreater than\\n>=\\ngreater than or equal to\\nControl Structures\\n|\\n187\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

The identifier\\ntrue is set to 1, and the identifier false is set to 0. For readability, whenever\\nlogical expressions are used, the identifiers true and false will be used here as the\\nvalue of the logical expression.\\nNow that we know how relational operators work, we can start learning how to\\nimplement decisions in a C++ program.

Because logical expressions evaluate to either 1 or 0, the value of\\na logical expression was stored in a variable of the data type int. Therefore, you can use\\nthe int data type to manipulate logical (Boolean) expressions.\\nRecall that nonzero values are treated as true. Now, consider the declarations:\\nint legalAge;\\nint age;\\nand the assignment statement:\\nlegalAge = 21;\\nIf you regard legalAge as a logical variable, the value of legalAge assigned by this\\nstatement is true.\\nThe assignment statement:\\nlegalAge = (age >= 21);\\nassigns the value 1 to legalAge if the value of age is greater than or equal to 21. The\\nstatement assigns the value 0 if the value of age is less than 21.\\nIt is interesting to note that !(!true) evaluates to true. However, !(!36) evaluates to 0\\nbecause as a logical expression 36 evaluates to 1, so !(36) evaluates to 0 and !(!36)=!(0)=1.\\nbool Data Type and Logical (Boolean) Expressions\\nMore recent versions of C++ contain a built-in data type, bool, that has the logical\\n(Boolean) values true and false. Therefore, you can manipulate logical (Boolean)\\nexpressions using the bool data type. Recall that in C++, bool, true, and false are\\nreserved words. In addition, the identifier true has the value 1, and the identifier false\\nhas the value 0.

There are situations when the logical expression is a combina-\\ntion of two or more logical expressions. For example, suppose weight and height are\\ndouble variables. Consider the following logical expression:\\nweight > 180 and height < 6.0\\nThis logical expression is a combination of the logical expressions weight > 180 and\\nheight < 6.0, and these logical expressions are combined using the word ‘‘and.’’ So how\\ndo we evaluate and implement such expressions in C++?\\nThis section describes how to form and evaluate logical expressions that are combinations\\nof other logical expressions. Logical (Boolean) operators enable you to combine\\nlogical expressions. C++ has three logical (Boolean) operators, as shown in Table 4-2.\\nLogical operators take only logical values as operands and yield only logical values as\\nresults. The operator ! is unary, so it has only one operand. The operators && and || are\\nbinary operators and there is no space within these operators. Tables 4-3, 4-4, and 4-5\\ndefine these operators.\\n4\\nTABLE 4-2\\nLogical (Boolean) Operators in C++\\nOperator\\nDescription\\n!\\nnot\\n&&\\nand\\n||\\nor\\nControl Structures\\n|\\n197\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

Suppose, how-\\never, that you want to execute more than one statement if the expression in an if or\\nif. . .else statement evaluates to true. To permit more complex statements, C++\\nprovides a structure called a compound statement or a block of statements. A\\ncompound statement takes the following form:\\n{\\nstatement_1\\nstatement_2\\n.\\n.\\n.\\nstatement_n\\n}\\nIn general, a compound statement consists of one or more statements enclosed in curly\\nbraces, {and }. In an if or if . . .else structure, a compound statement functions as if it\\nwas a single statement. Thus, instead of having a simple two-way selection similar to the\\nfollowing code:\\nif (age >= 18)\\ncout << \"Eligible to vote.\" << endl;\\nelse\\ncout << \"Not eligible to vote.\" << endl;\\nyou could include compound statements, similar to the following code:\\nif (age >= 18)\\n{\\ncout << \"Eligible to vote.\" << endl;\\ncout << \"No longer a minor.\" << endl;\\n}\\nelse\\n{\\ncout << \"Not eligible to vote.\" << endl;\\ncout << \"Still a minor.\" << endl;\\n}\\nThe compound statement is very useful and will be used in most of the structured\\nstatements in this book.\\nMultiple Selections: Nested if\\nIn the previous sections, you learned how to implement one-way and two-way selections\\nin a program.

The rule to pair an else with an\\nif is as follows:\\nPairingan else withan if: In a nested if statement, C++associates an else withthe most\\nrecent incomplete if—that is, the most recent if that has not been paired with an else.\\nUsing this rule, in Example 4-16, the else in Line 3 is paired with the if in Line 1. The else\\nin Line 6 is paired with the if in Line 4, and the else in Line 9 is paired with the if in Line 7.\\nThis means that the block for each else extends from the else all the way to line 10.\\nTo avoid excessive indentation, the code in Example 4-16 can be rewritten as follows:\\nif (balance > 50000.00)\\n//Line 1\\ninterestRate = 0.07;\\n//Line 2\\nelse if (balance >= 25000.00)\\n//Line 3\\ninterestRate = 0.05;\\n//Line 4\\nelse if (balance >= 1000.00)\\n//Line 5\\ninterestRate = 0.03;\\n//Line 6\\nelse\\n//Line 7\\ninterestRate = 0.00;\\n//Line 8\\nThe following examples will help you to see the various ways in which you can use\\nnested if structures to implement multiple selection.\\n206\\n|\\nChapter 4: Control Structures I (Selection)\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

If month is 1, then in\\nprogram segment (a), the expression in the if statement in Line 1 evaluates to true. The\\nstatement (in Line 2) associated with this if then executes; the rest of the structure,\\nwhich is the else of this if statement, is skipped; and the remaining if statements are\\nnot evaluated. In program segment (b), the computer has to evaluate the expression in\\neach if statement because there is no else statement. As a consequence, program\\nsegment (b) executes more slowly than does program segment (a).\\nIn a sequence of if...else statements, such as (a), if more than one condition is true,\\nonly the statements associated with the first true condition will be executed. On the\\nother hand, in a series of if statements, such as (b), if more than one condition evaluates\\nto true, statements associated with each true condition will execute.\\nShort-Circuit Evaluation\\nLogical expressions in C++ are evaluated using a highly efficient algorithm. This algo-\\nrithm is illustrated with the help of the following statements:\\n(x > y) || (x == 5)\\n//Line 1\\n(a == b) && (x >= 7)\\n//Line 2\\nIn the statement in Line 1, the two operands of the operator || are the expressions\\n(x > y) and (x == 5). This expression evaluates to true if either the operand (x > y)\\nis true or the operand (x == 5) is true. With short-circuit evaluation, the computer\\nevaluates the logical expression from left to right. As soon as the final value of the\\nentire logical expression is known, the evaluation stops. For example, in statement 1,\\nif the operand (x > y) evaluates to true, then the entire expression evaluates to true\\nbecause true || true is true and true || false is true. Therefore, the value of\\nthe operand (x == 5) has no bearing on the final outcome.\\nSimilarly, in the statement in Line 2, the two operands of the operator && are (a == b)\\nand (x >= 7). If the operand (a == b) evaluates to false, then the entire expression\\nevaluates to false because false && true is false and false && false is false.\\n4\\nControl Structures\\n|\\n209\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

Once an input stream enters a fail state, all subsequent input statements associated\\nwith that input stream are ignored, and the computer continues to execute the program,\\nwhich produces erroneous results.

In addition, the expression is usually a logical\\nexpression. However, C++ allows you to use any expression that can be evaluated to either\\ntrue or false as an expression in the if structure. Consider the following statement:\\nif (x = 5)\\ncout << \"The value is five.\" << endl;\\nThe expression—that is, the decision maker—in the if statement is x = 5. The\\nexpression x = 5 is called an assignment expression because the operator = appears in\\nthe expression and there is no semicolon at the end.\\nThis expression is evaluated as follows. First, the right side of the operator = is evaluated,\\nwhich evaluates to 5. The value 5 is then assigned to x. Moreover, the value 5—that is, the\\nnew value of x—also becomes the value of the expression in the if statement—that is, the\\nvalue of the assignment expression. Because 5 is nonzero, the expression in the if statement\\nevaluates to true, so the statement part of the if statement outputs: The value is five.\\nIn general, the expression x = a, where a is a nonzero integer, will always evaluate to true.\\nHowever, the expression x = 0 will evaluate to false.\\nNo matter how experienced a programmer is, almost everyone makes the mistake of\\nusing = in place of == at one time or another. One reason why these two operators are\\noften confused is that some programming languages use = as an equality operator. Thus,\\nexperience with such programming languages can create confusion. Sometimes the error\\nis merely typographical, another reason to be careful when typing code.\\nDespite the fact that an assignment expression can be used as an expression, using the\\nassignment operator in place of the equality operator can cause serious problems in a\\nprogram. For example, suppose that the discount on a car insurance policy is based on the\\ninsured’s driving record. A driving record of 1 means that the driver is accident-free and\\nreceives a 25% discount on the policy. The statement:\\nif (drivingCode == 1)\\ncout << \"The discount on the policy is 25%.\" << endl;\\noutputs:\\nThe discount on the policy is 25%.\\nonly if the value of drivingCode is 1.

The statement:\\nx == y + z;\\ncompares the value of the expression y + z with the value of x; the value of x remains the\\nsame, however.

Now that we have started discussing control structures, in this section,\\nwe give some general guidelines to properly indent your program.\\nAs you write programs, typos and errors are unavoidable. If your program is properly\\nindented, you can spot and fix errors quickly, as shown by several examples in this\\nchapter. Typically, the IDE that you use will automatically indent your program. If for\\nsome reason your IDE does not indent your program, you can indent your program\\nyourself.\\nProper indentation can show the natural grouping and subordination of statements. You\\nshould insert a blank line between statements that are naturally separate. In this book, the\\nstatements inside braces, the statements of a selection structure, and an if statement\\nwithin an if statement are all indented four spaces to the right. Throughout the book,\\nwe use four spaces to indent statements, especially to show the levels of control structures\\nwithin other control structures. Note that for larger more complex programs, there is a\\ntradeoff with the indentation spacing and readability due to continuation lines. Some\\nprograms indent only two or three spaces if there are several levels of subordination.\\nThere are two commonly used styles for placing braces. In this book, we place braces\\non a line by themselves. Also, matching left and right braces are in the same column,\\nthat is, they are the same number of spaces away from the left margin. This style of\\nplacing braces easily shows the grouping of the statements and also matches left and\\nright braces. You can also follow this style to place and indent braces.\\nIn the second style of placing braces, the left brace need not be on a line by itself.\\nTypically, for control structures, the left brace is placed after the last right parenthesis of\\nthe (logical) expression, and the right brace is on a line by itself. This style might save\\nsome vertical space. However, sometimes this style might not immediately show the\\ngrouping or the block of the statements and results in slightly poorer readability.\\nNo matter what style of indentation you use, you should be consistent within your\\nprograms, and the indentation should show the structure of the program.\\n222\\n|\\nChapter 4: Control Structures I (Selection)\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

You will see the use of a switch statement in the program-\\nming example at the end of this chapter. Even though no fixed rules exist that can be applied\\nto decide whether to use an if. . .else structure or a switch structure to implement\\nmultiple selections, the following considerations should be remembered. If multiple selec-\\ntions involve a range of values, you can use either a switch structure (wherein you convert\\neach range to a finite set of values), or an if...else structure.\\nFor instance, in Example 4-24, the value of grade depends on the value of score. If\\nscore is between 0 and 59, grade is \\'F\\'. Because score is an int variable, 60 values\\ncorrespond to the grade of \\'F\\'. If you list all 60 values as case values, the switch\\nstatement could be very long. However, dividing by 10 reduces these 60 values to only 6\\nvalues: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.\\nIf the range of values consists of infinitely many values and you cannot reduce them to a set\\ncontaining a finite number of values, you must use the if...else structure. For example, if\\nscore happens to be a double variable and fractional scores are possible, the number of values\\nbetween 0 and 60 is infinite. However, you can use the expression static_cast<int>\\n(score) / 10 and still reduce this infinite number of values to just six values.\\nAvoiding Bugs by Avoiding Partially Understood Concepts\\nand Techniques (Revisited)\\nEarlier in this chapter, we discussed how a partial understanding of a concept or technique\\ncan lead to errors in a program. In this section, we give another example to illustrate the\\nproblem of using partially understood concepts and techniques. In Example 4-24, we\\nillustrate how to assign a grade based on a test score between 0 and 100. Next, consider\\nthe following program that assigns a grade based on a test score:\\n//Grade program with bugs.\\n#include <iostream>\\n//Line 1\\nusing namespace std;\\n//Line 2\\nint main()\\n//Line 3\\n{\\n//Line 4\\nint testScore;\\n//Line 5\\ncout << \"Enter the test score: \";\\n//Line 6\\ncin >> testScore;\\n//Line 7\\n232\\n|\\nChapter 4: Control Structures I (Selection)\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

The third statement is designed to\\nexecute certain statements only if ch is an uppercase letter.\\nFor all of these statements (for that matter, in any situation), if conditions are not met, it\\nwould be useful to halt program execution with a message indicating where in the program\\nan error occurred. You could handle these types of situations by including output and return\\nstatements in your program. However, C++ provides an effective method to halt a program\\nif required conditions are not met through the assert function.\\nThe syntax to use the assert function is:\\nassert(expression);\\nHere, expression is any logical expression. If expression evaluates to true, the next\\nstatement executes. If expression evaluates to false, the program terminates and indicates\\nwhere in the program the error occurred.\\nThe specification of the assert function is found in the header file cassert. Therefore,\\nfor a program to use the assert function, it must include the following statement:\\n#include <cassert>\\nA statement using the assert function is sometimes called an assert statement.\\nReturning to the preceding statements, you can rewrite statement 1 (quotient =\\nnumerator / denominator;) using the assert function. Because quotient should\\nbe calculated only if denominator is nonzero, you include an assert statement before\\nthe assignment statement as follows:\\nassert(denominator);\\nquotient = numerator / denominator;\\nNow, if denominator is 0, the assert statement halts the execution of the program\\nwith an error message similar to the following:\\nAssertion failed: denominator, file c:\\\\temp\\\\assert\\nfunction\\\\assertfunction.cpp, line 20\\nThis error message indicates that the assertion of denominator failed. The error message\\nalso gives the name of the file containing the source code and the line number where the\\nassertion failed.\\n4\\nTerminating a Program with the assert Function\\n|\\n235\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

Of course, the statement can be either a simple\\nor compound statement. The expression acts as a decision maker and is usually a\\nlogical expression. The statement is called the body of the loop. Note that the\\nparentheses around the expression are part of the syntax. Figure 5-1 shows the flow\\nof execution of a while loop.\\nThe expression provides an entry condition to the loop. If it initially evaluates\\nto true, the statement executes. The loop condition—the expression—is then\\nreevaluated. If it again evaluates to true, the statement executes again. The state-\\nment (body of the loop) continues to execute until the expression is no longer true.\\nA loop that continues to execute endlessly is called an infinite loop. To avoid an infinite\\nloop, make sure that the loop’s body contains statement(s) that assure that the entry\\ncondition—the expression in the while statement—will eventually be false.\\n5\\nexpression\\nstatement\\ntrue\\nfalse\\nFIGURE 5-1\\nwhile loop\\nwhile Looping (Repetition) Structure\\n|\\n267\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

Typically, the expression checks whether a variable, called the\\nloop control variable (LCV), satisfies certain conditions. For example, in Example 5-1, the\\nexpression in the while statement checks whether i <= 20. The LCV must be properly\\ninitialized before the while loop is encountered, and it should eventually make the expres-\\nsion evaluate to false. We do this by updating or assigning a new value to the LCV in the\\nbody of the while loop. Therefore, generally while loops are written in the following form:\\n//initialize the loop control variable(s)\\nwhile (expression)\\n//expression tests the LCV\\n{\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n//update the LCV\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n}\\nFor instance, in Example 5-1, the statement in Line 1 initializes the LCV i to 0. The\\nexpression, i <= 20, in Line 2, checks whether i is less than or equal to 20. The\\nstatement in Line 5 updates the value of i, which eventually makes i greater than 20 and\\nthe expression, i <= 20, evaluates to false.\\nIt is possible that the expression in the while statement may contain more than one\\nvariable to control the loop. In that case, the loop has more than one LCV and all LCVs\\nmust be properly initialized and updated.\\nEXAMPLE 5-2\\nConsider the following C++ program segment:\\ni = 20;\\n//Line 1\\nwhile (i < 20)\\n//Line 2\\n{\\n//Line 3\\ncout << i << \" \";\\n//Line 4\\ni = i + 5;\\n//Line 5\\n}\\n//Line 6\\ncout << endl;\\n//Line 7\\nIt is easy to overlook the difference between this example and Example 5-1. In this example, at\\nLine 1, i is initialized to 20, which makes the expression i < 20 in the while statement\\n(Line 2) evaluate to false. Because initially the loop entry condition, i < 20, is false, the\\nbody of the while loop never executes. Hence, no values are output and the value of i remains\\n20. This example demonstrates the importance of the value to which the LCV is initialized.\\nwhile Looping (Repetition) Structure\\n|\\n271\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

For\\nexample, suppose you know exactly how many pieces of data (or entries) need to be read.\\nIn such cases, the while loop assumes the form of a counter-controlled while loop.\\nThat is, the LCV serves as a ‘‘counter.’’ Suppose that a set of statements needs to be executed\\nN times. You can set up a counter (initialized to 0 before the while statement) to track\\nhow many items have been read. Before executing the body of the while statement, the\\ncounter is compared with N. If counter < N, the body of the while statement executes.\\nThe body of the loop continues to execute until the value of counter >= N. Thus, inside\\nthe body of the while statement, the value of counter increments by 1 after it reads a new\\nitem. In this case, the while loop might look like the following:\\ncounter = 0;\\n//initialize the loop control variable\\nwhile (counter < N) //test the loop control variable\\n{\\n.\\n.\\n.\\ncounter++;\\n//update the loop control variable\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n}\\nIf N represents the number of data items in a file, then the value of N can be determined several\\nways. The program can prompt you to enter the number of items in the file and an input\\nstatement can read the value you entered; or you can specify the first item in the file as the\\nnumber of items in the file, so that you need not remember the number of input values (items).\\nThis is useful if someone other than the programmer enters the data. Consider Example 5-3.\\nEXAMPLE 5-3\\nStudents at a local middle school volunteered to sell fresh baked cookies to raise funds to\\nincrease the number of computers for the computer lab. Each student reported the number\\nof boxes he/she sold. We will write a program that will output the total number of boxes of\\ncookies sold, the total revenue generated by selling the cookies, and the average number of\\nboxes sold by each student. The data provided is in the following form:\\nstudentName numOf BoxesSold\\nConsider the following program:\\n//Program: Counter-Controlled Loop\\n//This program computes and outputs the total number of boxes of\\n//cookies sold, the total revenue, and the average number of\\n//boxes sold by each volunteer.\\n272\\n|\\nChapter 5: Control Structures II (Repetition)\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

The program then prompts the user to guess the number. If the user guesses\\nthe number correctly, the program outputs an appropriate message. Otherwise, the\\nprogram checks whether the guessed number is less than the random number. If the\\nguessed number is less than the random number generated by the program, the program\\noutputs the message ‘‘Your guess is lower than the number. Guess again!’’; otherwise, the\\nprogram outputs the message ‘‘Your guess is higher than the number. Guess again!’’. The\\nprogram then prompts the user to enter another number. The user is prompted to guess\\nthe random number until the user enters the correct number.\\nTo generate a random number, you can use the function rand from the header file\\ncstdlib. For example, the expression rand() returns an int value between 0 and\\n32767. Therefore, the statement:\\ncout << rand() << \", \" << rand() << endl;\\nwill output two numbers that appear to be random. However, each time the program is run,\\nthis statement will output the same random numbers. This is because the function rand uses\\nan algorithm that produces the same sequence of random numbers each time the program is\\nexecuted on the same system. To generate different random numbers each time the program\\nis executed, you also use the function srand from the header file cstdlib. The function\\nsrand takes as input an unsigned int, which acts as the seed for the algorithm. By\\nspecifying different seed values, each time the program is executed, the function rand will\\ngenerate a different sequence of random numbers. To specify a different seed, you can use\\nthe function time from the header file ctime, which returns the number of seconds elapsed\\nsince January 1, 1970. For example, consider the following statements:\\nsrand(time(0));\\nnum = rand() % 100;\\nThe first statement sets the seed, and the second statement generates a random number\\ngreater than or equal to 0 and less than 100. Note how the function time is used. It is\\nused with an argument, that is, parameter, which is 0.\\nThe program uses the bool variable isGuessed to control the loop. The bool variable\\nisGuessed is initialized to false. It is set to true when the user guesses the correct\\nnumber.\\n//Flag-controlled while loop.\\n//Number guessing game.\\n#include <iostream>\\n#include <cstdlib>\\n#include <ctime>\\n282\\n|\\nChapter 5: Control Structures II (Repetition)\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

However, given any first two numbers, using this\\nprocess, you can determine the nth number, an,n >= 3, of the sequence. We will\\nagain call such a sequence a Fibonacci sequence. Suppose a2 = 6 and a1 = 3.\\nThen:\\na3 ¼ a2 þ a1 ¼ 6 þ 3 ¼ 9; a4 ¼ a3 þ a2 ¼ 9 þ 6 ¼ 15\\nNext, we write a program that determines the nth Fibonacci number given the first\\ntwo numbers.\\nInput\\nThe first two Fibonacci numbers and the desired Fibonacci number.\\nOutput\\nThe nth Fibonacci number.\\nPROBLEM\\nANALYSIS\\nAND\\nALGORITHM\\nDESIGN\\nTo find, say, the tenth Fibonacci number of a sequence, you must first find a9 and a8,\\nwhich requires you to find a7 and a6, and so on. Therefore, to find a10, you must first\\nfind a3, a4, a5, . . ., a9. This discussion translates into the following algorithm:\\n1.\\nGet the first two Fibonacci numbers.\\n2.\\nGet the desired Fibonacci position. That is, get the position, n, of the\\nFibonacci number in the sequence.\\n3.\\nCalculate the next Fibonacci number by adding the previous two\\nelements of the Fibonacci sequence.\\n4.\\nRepeat Step 3 until the nth Fibonacci number is found.\\n5.\\nOutput the nth Fibonacci number.\\nNote that the program assumes that the first number of the Fibonacci sequence is less\\nthan or equal to the second number of the Fibonacci sequence, and both numbers are\\nnonnegative. Moreover, the program also assumes that the user enters a valid value for\\nthe position of the desired number in the Fibonacci sequence; that is, it is a positive\\ninteger. (See Programming Exercise 11 at the end of this chapter.)\\nVariables Because the previous two numbers must be known in order to find the current\\nFibonacci number, you need the following variables: two variables—say,\\nprevious1 and previous2 to hold the previous two numbers of the Fibonacci\\nsequence; and one variable—say, current—to hold the current Fibonacci\\nnumber. The number of times that Step 2 of the algorithm repeats depends on\\nthe position of the Fibonacci number you are calculating. For example, if you\\nwant to calculate the tenth Fibonacci number, you must execute Step 3 eight\\ntimes. (Remember—the user gives the first two numbers of the Fibonacci\\nsequence.) Therefore, you need a variable to store the number of times Step 3\\nshould execute. You also need a variable to track the number of times Step 3 has\\nexecuted, the loop control variable. You therefore need five variables for the data\\nmanipulation:\\nint previous1;\\n//variable to store the first Fibonacci number\\nint previous2;\\n//variable to store the second Fibonacci number\\n292\\n|\\nChapter 5: Control Structures II (Repetition)\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

The for loop in Line 5 executes n times. In the for loop, counter is\\ninitialized to 1 and is incremented by 1 after each iteration of the loop. Therefore, counter\\nranges from 1 to n. Each time through the loop, the value of counter is added to sum. The\\nvariable sum was initialized to 0, counter ranges from 1 to n, and the current value of\\ncounter is added to the value of sum. Therefore, after the for loop executes, sum contains\\nthe sum of the first n values, which in the sample run is 100 positive integers.\\nRecall that putting one control structure statement inside another is called nesting. The\\nfollowing programming example demonstrates a simple instance of nesting. It also nicely\\ndemonstrates counting.\\nPROGRAMMING EXAMPLE: Classifying Numbers\\nThis program reads a given set of integers and then prints the number of odd and\\neven integers. It also outputs the number of zeros.\\nThe program reads 20 integers, but you can easily modify it to read any set of\\nnumbers. In fact, you can modify the program so that it first prompts the user to\\nspecify how many integers are to be read.\\nInput\\n20 integers—positive, negative, or zeros.\\nOutput\\nThe number of zeros, even numbers, and odd numbers.\\nPROBLEM\\nANALYSIS\\nAND\\nALGORITHM\\nDESIGN\\nAfter reading a number, you need to check whether it is even or odd. Suppose the\\nvalue is stored in number. Divide number by 2 and check the remainder. If the\\nremainder is 0, number is even. Increment the even count and then check whether\\nnumber is 0. If it is, increment the zero count. If the remainder is not 0, increment\\nthe odd count.\\nThe program uses a switch statement to decide whether number is odd or even.\\nSuppose that number is odd. Dividing by 2 gives the remainder 1 if number is\\npositive and the remainder -1 if it is negative. If number is even, dividing by 2 gives\\nthe remainder 0 whether number is positive or negative. You can use the mod\\noperator, %, to find the remainder. For example:\\n6 % 2 = 0; -4 % 2 = 0; -7 % 2 = -1; 15 % 2 = 1\\nProgramming Example: Classifying Numbers\\n|\\n303\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Similarly, you can use the break statement in\\nwhile, for, and do. . .while loops to immediately exit from the loop structure.\\nThe break statement is typically used for two purposes:\\n•\\nTo exit early from a loop.\\n•\\nTo skip the remainder of the switch structure.\\nAfter the break statement executes, the program continues to execute with the first\\nstatement after the structure. The use of a break statement in a loop can eliminate the\\nuse of certain (flag) variables. The following C++ code segment helps illustrate this idea.\\n(Assume that all variables are properly declared.)\\n5\\nbreak and continue Statements\\n|\\n311\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

(In an ‘‘off-by-one problem,’’ either the loop executes\\none too many or one too few times.) We can eliminate this problem by correctly setting the\\nvalues of the loop control variable. For example, we can rewrite the loops as follows:\\nfor (i = 1; i <= 3; i++)\\n{\\nsum = 0;\\nfor (j = 1; j <= 4; j++)\\n{\\ninfile >> num;\\ncout << num << \" \";\\nsum = sum + num;\\n}\\ncout << \"sum = \" << sum << endl;\\n}\\nThis code fixes the original problem without using a software patch. It also represents\\ngood programming practice. The complete modified program is available at the Web site\\naccompanying this book and is named Ch5_LoopWithBugsCorrectedProgram.cpp.\\nDebugging Loops\\nAs we have seen in the earlier debugging sections, no matter how careful a program is\\ndesigned and coded, errors are likely to occur. If there are syntax errors, the compiler will\\nidentify them. However, if there are logical errors, we must carefully look at the code or\\neven maybe at the design and try to find the errors. To increase the reliability of the\\nprogram, errors must be discovered and fixed before the program is released to the users.\\nOnce an algorithm is written, the next step is to verify that it works properly. If the algorithm\\nis a simple sequential flow or contains a branch, it can be hand traced or you can use the\\ndebugger, if any, provided by the IDE. Typically, loops are harder to debug. The correctness\\nof a loop can be verified by using loop invariants. A loop invariant is a set of statements that\\nremains true each time the loop body is executed. Let p be a loop invariant and q be the\\n(logical) expression in a loop statement. Then p && q remains true before each iteration of the\\nloop and p && not(q) is true after the loop terminates. The full discussion of loop invariants is\\nbeyondthescopeofthebook.However,youcanlearnaboutloopinvariantsinthebook: Discrete\\nMathematics: Theory and Applications (Revised Edition), D.S. Malik and M.K. Sen, Cengage\\nLearning Asia, Singapore, 2010. Here, we give a few tips that you can use to debug a loop.\\nAs discussed in the previous section, the most common error associated with loops is off-\\nby-one. If a loop turns out to be an infinite loop, the error is most likely in the logical\\nexpression that controls the execution of the loop. Check the logical expression carefully\\nand see if you have reversed an inequality, an assignment statement symbol appears in place\\nof the equality operator, or && appears in place of ||. If the loop changes the values of\\nvariables, you can print the values of the variables before and/or after each iteration or you\\ncan use your IDE’s debugger, if any, and watch the values of variables during each iteration.\\n322\\n|\\nChapter 5: Control Structures II (Repetition)\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

The function abs is from the header file cstdlib.)\\n17.\\nWrite a program to implement the algorithm that you designed in Exercise\\n21 of Chapter 1. Your program should allow the user to buy as many items\\nas the user desires.\\n18.\\nThe program in Example 5-4 uses a sentinel control loop to process\\ncookies sales data. Assume that the data is provided in a file and the first\\nline in the file specifies the cost of one box. Modify the program so that it\\nuses an EOF-controlled loop to process the data.\\n19.\\nEnhance the program that you wrote in Exercise 18 by modifying it as\\nfollows: When the students started selling cookies, they were told that the\\nstudents who sell the maximum number of boxes will have 10% of the money\\nthey generate donated to their favorite charitable organization. So, in addition\\nto the output your program generated in Exercise 18, your program should\\noutput the names of all the students selling the maximum number of boxes\\nand the amount that will be donated to their charitable organization.\\n20.\\nWhen you borrow money to buy a house, a car, or for some other purpose,\\nyou repay the loan by making periodic payments over a certain period of time.\\nOf course, the lending company will charge interest on the loan. Every\\nperiodic payment consists of the interest on the loan and the payment toward\\nthe principal amount. To be specific, suppose that you borrow $1000 at the\\ninterest rate of 7.2% per year and the payments are monthly. Suppose that your\\nmonthly payment is $25. Now, the interest is 7.2% per year and the payments\\nare monthly, so the interest rate per month is 7.2/12 ¼ 0.6%. The first month’s\\ninterest on $1000 is 1000 \\x04 0.006 ¼ 6. Because the payment is $25 and\\ninterest for the first month is $6, the payment toward the principal amount is\\n25 – 6 ¼ 19. This means after making the first payment, the loan amount is\\n1000 – 19 ¼ 981. For the second payment, the interest is calculated on $981.\\nSo the interest for the second month is 981 \\x04 0.006 ¼ 5.886, that is,\\napproximately $5.89. This implies that the payment toward the principal is\\n25 – 5.89 ¼ 19.11 and the remaining balance after the second payment is 981 –\\n19.11 ¼ 961.89. This process is repeated until the loan is paid. Write a\\nprogram that accepts as input the loan amount, the interest rate per year,\\nand the monthly payment. (Enter the interest rate as a percentage. For\\nexample, if the interest rate is 7.2% per year, then enter 7.2.) The program\\nthen outputs the number of months it would take to repay the loan. (Note\\nthat if the monthly payment is less than the first month’s interest, then after\\neach payment, the loan amount will increase. In this case, the program\\nmust warn the borrower that the monthly payment is too low, and with\\nthis monthly payment, the loan amount could not be repaid.)\\nProgramming Exercises\\n|\\n341\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

One such\\nfunction is main. The programs in Chapters 1 through 5 use only the function\\nmain; the programming instructions are packed into one function. This technique,\\nhowever, is good only for short programs. For large programs, it is not practical\\n(although it is possible) to put the entire programming instructions into one function,\\nas you will soon discover. You must learn to break the problem into manageable\\npieces. This chapter first discusses the functions previously defined and then discusses\\nuser-defined functions.\\nLet us imagine an automobile factory. When an automobile is manufactured, it is not\\nmade from basic raw materials; it is put together from previously manufactured parts.\\nSome parts are made by the company itself; others, by different companies.\\nFunctions are like building blocks. They let you divide complicated programs into\\nmanageable pieces. They have other advantages, too:\\n•\\nWhile working on one function, you can focus on just that part of the\\nprogram and construct it, debug it, and perfect it.\\n•\\nDifferent people can work on different functions simultaneously.\\n•\\nIf a function is needed in more than one place in a program or in\\ndifferent programs, you can write it once and use it many times.\\n•\\nUsing functions greatly enhances the program’s readability because it\\nreduces the complexity of the function main.\\nFunctions are often called modules. They are like miniature programs; you can put\\nthem together to form a larger program. When user-defined functions are discussed,\\nyou will see that this is the case. This ability is less apparent with predefined functions\\nbecause their programming code is not available to us. However, because predefined\\nfunctions are already written for us, you will learn these first so that you can use them\\nwhen needed.\\nPredefined Functions\\nBefore formally discussing predefined functions in C++, let us review a concept from a\\ncollege algebra course. In algebra, a function can be considered a rule or correspondence\\nbetween values, called the function’s arguments, and the unique values of the function\\nassociated with the arguments. Thus, if f(x) = 2x + 5, then f(1) = 7, f(2) = 9, and\\nf(3) = 11, where 1, 2, and 3 are the arguments of f, and 7, 9, and 11 are the\\ncorresponding values of the function f.\\nIn C++, the concept of a function, either predefined or user-defined, is similar to that of\\na function in algebra. For example, every function has a name and, depending on the\\nvalues specified by the user, it does some computation. This section discusses various\\npredefined functions.\\n346\\n|\\nChapter 6: User-Defined Functions\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

These\\nfunctions do not use a return statement to return a value.\\nWe will first discuss value-returning functions. Many of the concepts discussed in regard\\nto value-returning functions also apply to void functions.\\nValue-Returning Functions\\nThe previous section introduced some predefined C++ functions such as pow, abs,\\nislower, and toupper. These are examples of value-returning functions. To use these\\nfunctions in your programs, you must know the name of the header file that contains the\\nfunctions’ specification. You need to include this header file in your program using the\\ninclude statement and know the following items:\\n1.\\nThe name of the function\\n2.\\nThe parameters, if any\\n3.\\nThe data type of each parameter\\n4.\\nThe data type of the value computed (that is, the value returned) by the\\nfunction, called the type of the function\\nBecause a value-returning function returns only one value, the natural thing for\\nyou to do is to use the value in one of three ways:\\n•\\nSave the value for further calculation. For example, x = pow(3.0, 2.5);\\n•\\nUse the value in some calculation. For example,\\narea = PI * pow(radius, 2.0);\\n•\\nPrint the value. For example, cout << abs(-5) << endl;\\nThis suggests that a value-returning function is used:\\n•\\nIn an assignment statement.\\n•\\nAs a parameter in a function call.\\n•\\nIn an output statement.\\nThat is, a value-returning function is used (called) in an expression.\\nBefore we look at the syntax of a user-defined, value-returning function, let us consider\\nthe things associated with such functions. In addition to the four properties described\\npreviously, one more thing is associated with functions (both value-returning and void):\\n5.\\nThe code required to accomplish the task\\nThe first four properties form, what is called, the heading of the function (also called the\\nfunction header); the fifth property is called the body of the function.

In this case, the values\\nof u and v are passed to the function pow. In fact, the value of u is copied into base, and\\nthe value of v is copied into exponent. The variables u and v that appear in the call to\\nthe function pow in Line 1 are called the actual parameters of that call. In Line 2, the\\nfunction pow is called with the parameters 2.0 and 3.2. In this call, the value 2.0 is\\ncopied into base, and 3.2 is copied into exponent. Moreover, in this call of the\\nfunction pow, the actual parameters are 2.0 and 3.2, respectively. Similarly, in Line 3,\\nthe actual parameters of the function pow are u and 7; the value of u is copied into base,\\nand 7.0 is copied into exponent.\\nWe can now formally present two definitions:\\nFormal Parameter: A variable declared in the function heading.\\nActual Parameter: A variable or expression listed in a call to a function.\\n352\\n|\\nChapter 6: User-Defined Functions\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

Following the rule that you\\nmust declare an identifier before you can use it and knowing that the function main uses\\nthe identifier larger, logically you must place larger before main.\\nIn reality, C++ programmers customarily place the function main before all other user-\\ndefined functions. However, this organization could produce a compilation error because\\nfunctions are compiled in the order in which they appear in the program. For example, if\\nthe function main is placed before the function larger, the identifier larger will be\\nundefined when the function main is compiled.

Then the expression x > 5 in Line 1 evaluates to true. So\\nthe return statement in Line 2 returns the value 20. Now suppose that x is 3. The\\nexpression x > 5 in Line 1 now evaluates to false. The if statement therefore fails, and\\nthe return statement in Line 2 does not execute. However, there are no more statements\\nto be executed in the body of the function. In this case, the function returns a strange\\nvalue. It thus follows that if the value of x is less than or equal to 5, the function does not\\ncontain any valid return statements to return a value of type int.\\nA correct definition of the function secret is:\\nint secret(int x)\\n{\\nif (x > 5)\\n//Line 1\\nreturn 2 * x;\\n//Line 2\\nreturn x;\\n//Line 3\\n}\\nHere, if the value of x is less than or equal to 5, the return statement in Line 3\\nexecutes, which returns the value of x. On the other hand, if the value of x is, say\\n10, the return statement in Line 2 executes, which returns the value 20 and also\\nterminates the function.\\nRecall that in a value-returning function, the return statement returns the value.\\nConsider the following return statement:\\nreturn x, y;\\n//only the value of y will be returned\\nThis is a legal return statement. You might think that this return statement is returning\\nthe values of x and y. However, this is not the case. Remember, a return statement returns\\nonly one value, even if the return statement contains more than one expression. If a return\\nstatement contains more than one expression, only the value of the last expression is returned.\\nTherefore, in the case of the above return statement, the value of y is returned. The\\nfollowing program further illustrates this concept:\\n// This program illustrates that a value-returning function\\n// returns only one value, even if the return statement\\n// contains more than one expression. This is a legal, but not\\n// a recommended code.\\n#include <iostream>\\nusing namespace std;\\nint funcRet1();\\nint funcRet2(int z);\\nValue-Returning Functions\\n|\\n361\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

In that\\nprogram, all of the programming instructions are packed in the function main. Here,\\nwe rewrite the same program using user-defined functions, further illustrating struc-\\ntured programming.\\nBecause there are two types of customers, residential and business, the program contains two\\nseparate functions: one to calculate the bill for residential customers and one to calculate the\\nbill for business customers. Both functions calculate the billing amount and then return the\\nbilling amount to the function main. The function main prints the amount due. Let us call\\nthe function that calculates the residential bill residential and the function that calculates\\nthe business bill business. The formulas to calculate the bills are the same as before.\\nFunction residential: To compute the residential bill, you need to know the number\\nof premium channels to which the customer subscribes. Based on the number of\\npremium channels, you can calculate the billing amount. After calculating the billing\\namount, the function returns the billing amount using the return statement. The\\nfollowing four steps describe this function:\\na.\\nPrompt the user for the number of premium channels.\\nb.\\nRead the number of premium channels.\\nc.\\nCalculate the amount due.\\nd.\\nReturn the amount due.\\nThis function contains a statement to prompt the user to enter the number of premium\\nchannels (Step a) and a statement to read the number of premium channels (Step b). Other\\nitems needed to calculate the billing amount, such as the cost of basic service connection and\\nbill processing fees, are defined as named constants (before the definition of the function\\nmain). Therefore, to calculate the billing amount, this function does not need to get any\\nvalue from the function main. This function, therefore, has no parameters.\\nFrom the previous discussion, it follows that the function residential requires local\\nvariables to store both the number of premium channels and the billing amount. This\\nfunction needs only these two local variables to calculate the billing amount:\\n6\\nValue-Returning Functions\\n|\\n369\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Recall that functions can\\nappear in any order. The only thing that you have to remember is that you must declare\\nan identifier before you can use it. The program is compiled by the compiler sequentially\\nfrom beginning to end. Thus, if the function main appears before any other user-defined\\nfunctions, it is compiled first. However, if main appears at the end (or middle) of the\\nprogram, all functions whose definitions (not prototypes) appear before the function\\nmain are compiled before the function main, in the order they are placed.\\nValue-Returning Functions\\n|\\n373\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

The compiler can then correctly translate a function call. However, when the\\nprogram executes, the first statement in the function main always executes first, regardless of\\nwhere in the program the function main is placed. Other functions execute only when\\nthey are called.\\nA function call transfers control to the first statement in the body of the function. In\\ngeneral, after the last statement of the called function executes, control is passed back\\nto the point immediately following the function call. A value-returning function\\nreturns a value. Therefore, after executing the value-returning function, when the\\ncontrol goes back to the caller, the value that the function returns replaces the\\nfunction call statement.

In this section,\\nyou will explore user-defined functions in general and, in particular, those C++ functions\\nthat do not have a data type, called void functions.\\nVoid functions and value-returning functions have similar structures. Both have a heading\\nand a body. Like value-returning functions, you can place user-defined void functions either\\nbefore or after the function main. However, the program execution always begins with the\\nfirst statement in the function main. If you place a user-defined void function after the\\nfunction main, you should place the function prototype before the function main. A void\\nfunction does not have a data type. Therefore, functionType—that is, the return type—in\\nthe heading part and the return statement in the body of the void functions are meaningless.\\nHowever, in a void function, you can use the return statement without any value; it is\\ntypically used to exit the function early. Like value-returning functions, void functions may\\nor may not have formal parameters.\\nBecause void functions do not have a data type, they are not used (called) in an expression.\\nA call to a void function is a stand-alone statement.

The\\nif. . .else statement in Line 8 determines and outputs the grade for the course. Because\\nthe output statement in Line 7 does not contain the newline character or the manipulator\\nendl, the output of the if. . .else statement is part of the fourth line of the output. After\\nthe if. . .else statement executes, control goes back to the function main. Because the\\nnext statement to execute in the function main is the last statement of the function main,\\nthe program terminates.\\nIn this program, the function main first calls the function getScore to obtain the\\ncourse score from the user. The function main then calls the function printGrade to\\ncalculate and print the grade based on this course score. The course score is retrieved by\\nthe function getScore; later, this course score is used by the function printGrade.\\nBecause the value retrieved by the getScore function is used later in the program, the\\nfunction getScore must pass this value outside. Because getScore is written as a void\\nfunction, the formal parameter that holds this value must be a reference parameter.\\nValue and Reference Parameters and Memory\\nAllocation\\nWhen a function is called, memory for its formal parameters and variables declared in\\nthe body of the function (called local variables) is allocated in the function data area.\\nRecall that in the case of a value parameter, the value of the actual parameter is copied\\ninto the memory cell of its corresponding formal parameter. In the case of a reference\\nparameter, the address of the actual parameter passes to the formal parameter. That is,\\nthe content of the formal parameter is an address. During data manipulation, the address\\nstored in the formal parameter directs the computer to manipulate the data of the\\nmemory cell at that address. Thus, in the case of a reference parameter, both the actual\\nand formal parameters refer to the same memory location. Consequently, during\\nprogram execution, changes made by the formal parameter permanently change the\\nvalue of the actual parameter.\\nStream variables (for example, ifstream and ofstream) should be passed by refer-\\nence to a function. After opening the input/output file or after reading and/or outputting\\ndata, the state of the input and/or output stream can then be passed outside the function.\\ncourseScore\\nmain\\ncScore\\nprintGrade\\n85 \\n85 \\nFIGURE 6-8\\nVariable courseScore and the parameter cScore\\n388\\n|\\nChapter 6: User-Defined Functions\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

You can also use reference parameters in a value-returning function,\\nalthough this approach is not recommended. By definition, a value-returning function\\nreturns a single value; this value is returned via the return statement. If a function needs\\nto return more than one value, as a rule of good programming style, you should change it to a\\nvoid function and use the appropriate reference parameters to return the values.\\nScope of an Identifier\\nThe previous sections presented several examples of programs with user-defined functions.\\nIdentifiers are declared in a function heading, within a block, or outside a block. A question\\nnaturally arises: Are you allowed to access any identifier anywhere in the program? The\\nanswer is no. You must follow certain rules to access an identifier. The scope of an identifier\\nrefers to where in the program an identifier is accessible (visible). Recall that an identifier is\\nthe name of something in C++, such as a variable or function name.\\nThis section examines the scope of an identifier. First, we define the following two terms:\\nLocal identifier: Identifiers declared within a function (or block).\\nLocal identifiers are not accessible outside of the function (block).\\nGlobal identifier: Identifiers declared outside of every function definition.\\nsquareFirst\\nref \\nval \\nmain\\nnum\\n14 \\n14 \\nFIGURE 6-16\\nParameters of the function squareFirst\\nScope of an Identifier\\n|\\n397\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

That is, the scope of a function name is the\\nsame as the scope of a global variable.\\nBefore considering an example to explain these scope rules, first note the scope of the\\nidentifier declared in the for statement. C++ allows the programmer to declare a variable in\\nthe initialization statement of the for statement. For example, the following for statement:\\nfor (int count = 1; count < 10; count++)\\ncout << count << endl;\\ndeclares the variable count and initializes it to 1. The scope of the variable count is\\nlimited to only the body of the for loop.\\nThis scope rule for the variable declared in a for statement may not apply to Standard C++,\\nthat is, non ANSI/ISO Standard C++. In Standard C++, the scope of the variable declared in\\nthe initialize statement may extend from the point at which it is declared until the end\\nof the block that immediately surrounds the for statement.

Similarly, the block marked four in function three cannot use\\nthe int variable a, which is declared in function three, because block four has an\\nidentifier named a.\\nBefore closing this section, let us note the following about global variables:\\n1.\\nChapter 2 stated that C++ does not automatically initialize variables.\\nHowever, some compilers initialize global variables to their default\\nvalues. For example, if a global variable is of type int, char, or double,\\nit is initialized to zero.\\n2.\\nIn C++, :: is called the scope resolution operator. By using the\\nscope resolution operator, a global variable declared before the definition\\nof a function (block) can be accessed by the function (or block) even if\\nthe function (or block) has an identifier with the same name as the\\nvariable. In the preceding program, by using the scope resolution\\noperator, the function main can refer to the global variable z as ::z.\\nSimilarly, suppose that a global variable t is declared before the defini-\\ntion of the function—say, funExample. Then, funExample can access\\nthe variable t using the scope resolution operator even if funExample\\nhas an identifier t. Using the scope resolution operator, funExample\\nrefers to the variable t as ::t. Also, in the preceding program, using the\\nscope resolution operator, function three can call function one.\\n3.\\nC++ provides a way to access a global variable declared after the defini-\\ntion of a function. In this case, the function must not contain any\\nidentifier with the same name as the global variable. In the preceding\\nprogram, the global variable w is declared after the definition of function\\none. The function one does not contain any identifier named w; there-\\nfore, w can be accessed by function one only if you declare w as an\\nexternal variable inside one. To declare w as an external variable inside\\nfunction one, the function one must contain the following statement:\\nextern int w;\\nIn C++, extern is a reserved word. The word extern in the\\nabove statement announces that w is a global variable declared elsewhere.\\nThus, when function one is called, no memory for w, as declared inside\\none, is allocated. In C++, external declaration also has another use, but\\nit is not discussed in this book.\\nGlobal Variables, Named Constants,\\nand Side Effects\\nA C++ program can contain global variables and you might be tempted to make all of the\\nvariables in a program global variables so that you do not have to worry about what a\\nfunction knows about which variable. Using global variables, however, has side effects. If\\nGlobal Variables, Named Constants, and Side Effects\\n|\\n401\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Because\\nnone of the functions has an identifier t, the variable t is accessible anywhere in the program.\\nAlso, the program consists of a void function with a reference parameter.\\nIn Line 3, the function main calls the function funOne, and the actual parameter passed\\nto funOne is t. So, a, the formal parameter of funOne, receives the address of t. Any\\nchanges that a makes to its value immediately change t. Because t can be directly\\naccessed anywhere in the program, in Line 9, the function funOne changes the value of t\\nby using t itself. Thus, you can manipulate the value of t by using either a reference\\nparameter or t itself.\\nIn the previous program, if the last value of t is incorrect, it would be difficult to\\ndetermine what went wrong and in which part of the program. We strongly recommend\\nthat you do not use global variables; instead, use the appropriate parameters.\\nIn the programs given in this book, we typically placed named constants before the function\\nmain, outside of every function definition. That is, the named constants we used are global\\nnamed constants. Unlike global variables, global named constants have no side effects because\\ntheir values cannot be changed during program execution. Moreover, placing a named\\nconstant in the beginning of the program can increase readability, even if it is used only in\\none function. If you need to later modify the program and change the value of a named\\nconstant, it will be easier to find if it is placed in the beginning of the program.\\nEXAMPLE 6-16 (FACTORING A SECOND DEGREE POLYNOMIAL)\\nIn an algebra course, one learns how to factor a polynomial by using various\\ntechniques. In this example, we write a program to factor a second degree\\npolynomial of the form x2 þ bx þ c, i.e., write x2 þ bx þ c ¼ ðx \\x02 uÞðx \\x02 vÞ. For\\nsimplicity, we restrict this program to factor polynomials, where b, c, u, and v are integers.\\nFor example, x2 þ 5x þ 6 ¼ ðx þ 2Þðx þ 3Þ, x2 þ 10x \\x02 24 ¼ ðx þ 12Þðx \\x02 2Þ, and\\nx2 \\x02 25 ¼ ðx þ 5Þðx \\x02 5Þ.\\nIt can be shown that the values of u and v are given by\\nu ¼ \\x02b þ\\nﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ\\nb2 \\x02 4c\\np\\n2\\nv ¼ \\x02b \\x02\\nﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ\\nb2 \\x02 4c\\np\\n2\\nIf b2 \\x02 4c < 0, then u and v are complex numbers; if b2 \\x02 4c > 0 and b2 \\x02 4c is not the\\nsquare of an integer, then u and v are not integers. Also, if b2 \\x02 4c is the square of an\\ninteger and \\x02b þ\\nﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ\\nb2 \\x02 4c\\np\\nand \\x02b \\x02\\nﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ\\nb2 \\x02 4c\\np\\nare not divisible by 2, then u and v are\\nnot integers.

For example, memory for the formal\\nparameters and local variables of a function is allocated when the func-\\ntion is called and deallocated when the function exits.\\nA variable for which memory is allocated at block entry and deallocated at block exit is\\ncalled an automatic variable. A variable for which memory remains allocated as long as\\nthe program executes is called a static variable. Global variables are static variables, and\\nby default, variables declared within a block are automatic variables. You can declare a\\nstatic variable within a block by using the reserved word static. The syntax for\\ndeclaring a static variable is:\\nstatic dataType identifier;\\nThe statement:\\nstatic int x;\\ndeclares x to be a static variable of type int.\\nStatic variables declared within a block are local to the block, and their scope is the same\\nas that of any other local identifier of that block.\\nMost compilers initialize static variables to their default values. For example, static int\\nvariables are initialized to 0. However, it is a good practice to initialize static variables\\nyourself, especially if the initial value is not the default value. In this case, static variables\\nare initialized when they are declared. The statement:\\nstatic int x = 0;\\ndeclares x to be a static variable of type int and initializes x to 0, the first time the\\nfunction is called.\\nEXAMPLE 6-18\\nThe following program shows how static and automatic variables behave.\\n//Program: Static and automatic variables\\n#include <iostream>\\nusing namespace std;\\nvoid test();\\nStatic and Automatic Variables\\n|\\n409\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

A program may contain a number of\\nfunctions. In a complex program, usually, when a function is written, it is tested and\\ndebugged alone. You can write a separate program to test the function. The program that\\ntests a function is called a driver program. For example, the program in Example 6-15\\ncontains functions to convert the length from feet and inches to meters and centimeters\\nand vice versa. Before writing the complete program, you could write separate driver\\nprograms to make sure that each function is working properly.\\nSometimes, the results calculated by one function are needed in another function. In that\\ncase, the function that depends on another function cannot be tested alone.

This is called function\\noverloading, or overloading a function name. Before we state the rules to over-\\nloading a function, let us define the following:\\nTwo functions are said to have different formal parameter lists if both functions have:\\n•\\nA different number of formal parameters or\\n•\\nThe same number of formal parameters and the data types of the formal\\nparameters, in the order listed, differ in at least one position.\\nFor example, consider the following function headings:\\nvoid functionOne(int x)\\nvoid functionTwo(int x, double y)\\nvoid functionThree(double y, int x)\\nint functionFour(char ch, int x, double y)\\nint functionFive(char ch, int x, string name)\\nThese functions all have different formal parameter lists.\\nNow consider the following function headings:\\nvoid functionSix(int x, double y, char ch)\\nvoid functionSeven(int one, double u, char firstCh)\\nThe functions functionSix and functionSeven both have three formal parameters,\\nand the data type of the corresponding parameters is the same. Therefore, these functions\\nhave the same formal parameter list. Note that it is the data types and not the parameter\\nnames or the return type that are examined.\\nTo overload a function name, any two definitions of the function must have different\\nformal parameter lists.\\nFunction overloading: Creating several functions with the same name.\\n6\\nFunction Overloading: An Introduction\\n|\\n413\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

Two\\nfunctions have different signatures if they have either different names or different formal para-\\nmeterlists.(Notethatthesignatureofafunctiondoesnotincludethereturntypeofthefunction.)\\nIf a function’s name is overloaded, then all of the functions in the set have the same name.\\nTherefore, all the functions in the overloaded set must have different formal parameter lists.\\nThus, the following function headings correctly overload the function functionXYZ:\\nvoid functionXYZ()\\nvoid functionXYZ(int x, double y)\\nvoid functionXYZ(double one, int y)\\nvoid functionXYZ(int x, double y, char ch)\\nConsider the following function headings to overload the function functionABC:\\nvoid functionABC(int x, double y)\\nint functionABC(int x, double y)\\nBoth of these function headings have the same name and same formal parameter list.\\nTherefore, these function headings to overload the function functionABC are incorrect.\\nIn this case, the compiler will generate a syntax error.

However, in this book, the\\nsignature of a function consists of the function’s heading and its formal parameter list. If\\nthe function’s names are different, then, of course, the compiler would have no problem\\nin identifying which function is called, and it will correctly translate the code.

You could write several\\nfunctions as follows:\\nint largerInt(int x, int y);\\nchar largerChar(char first, char second);\\ndouble largerDouble(double u, double v);\\nstring largerString(string first, string second);\\nThe function largerInt determines the larger of two integers; the function largerChar\\ndetermines the larger of two characters, and so on. All of these functions perform similar\\noperations. Instead of giving different names to these functions, you can use the same\\nname—say, larger—for each function; that is, you can overload the function larger.\\nThus, you can write the previous function prototypes simply as:\\n414\\n|\\nChapter 6: User-Defined Functions\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

To simplify the function main and further\\nillustrate parameter passing, the program includes:\\n•\\nA function initialize to initialize the variables, such as zeros,\\nodds, and evens.\\n•\\nA function getNumber to get the number.\\n•\\nA function classifyNumber to determine whether the number is\\nodd or even (and whether it is also zero).

The variables that\\nwe need to initialize are zeros, odds, and evens. As before, their initial values are\\nall zero. Clearly, this function has three parameters. Because the values of the formal\\nparameters initializing these variables must be passed outside of the function, these\\nformal parameters must be reference parameters.

In subsequent chapters, you worked mainly with\\nintegral and floating-point data types. In this chapter, you will learn about the enum\\ntype. Moreover, the statement using namespace std; (discussed in Chapter 2) is used\\nin every C++ program that uses ANSI/ISO Standard C++ style header files. The second\\nhalf of this chapter examines the purpose of this statement. In fact, you will learn what the\\nnamespace mechanism is. You will also learn about the string type and many useful\\nfunctions that you can use to effectively manipulate strings.\\nEnumeration Type\\nThis section may be skipped without any loss of continuity.\\nChapter 2 defined a data type as a set of values together with a set of operations on them.\\nFor example, the\\nint data type consists of integers from -2,147,483,648 to\\n2,147,483,647 and the set of operations on these numbers—namely, the arithmetic\\noperations (+, -, *, /, and %). Because the main objective of a program is to manipulate\\ndata, the concept of a data type becomes fundamental to any programming language. By\\nproviding data types, you specify what values are legal and tell the user what kinds of\\noperations are allowed on those values. The system thus provides you with built-in\\nchecks against errors.\\nThe data types that you have worked with until now were mostly int, bool, char, and\\ndouble. Even though these data types are sufficient to solve just about any problem,\\nsituations occur when these data types are not adequate to solve a particular problem.\\nC++ provides a mechanism for users to create their own data types, which greatly\\nenhances the flexibility of the programming language.\\nIn this section, you will learn how to create your own simple data types, known as the\\nenumeration types. In ensuing chapters, you will learn more advanced techniques to\\ncreate complex data types.\\nTo define an enumeration type, you need the following items:\\n•\\nA name for the data type\\n•\\nA set of values for the data type\\n•\\nA set of operations on the values\\nC++ lets you define a new simple data type wherein you specify its name and values, but\\nnot the operations. Preventing users from creating their own operations helps to avoid\\npotential system failures.\\nThe values that you specify for the data type must be identifiers.\\n466\\n|\\nChapter 7: User-Defined Simple Data Types, Namespaces, and the string Type\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

This game has two players,\\neach of whom chooses one of the three objects: rock, paper, or scissors. If player 1\\nchooses rock and player 2 chooses paper, player 2 wins the game because paper\\ncovers the rock. The game is played according to the following rules:\\n•\\nIf both players choose the same object, this play is a tie.\\n•\\nIf one player chooses rock and the other chooses scissors, the player\\nchoosing the rock wins this play because the rock breaks the scissors.\\n•\\nIf one player chooses rock and the other chooses paper, the player\\nchoosing the paper wins this play because the paper covers the rock.\\n•\\nIf one player chooses scissors and the other chooses paper, the player\\nchoosing the scissors wins this play because the scissors cut the paper.\\nWrite an interactive program that allows two people to play this game.\\nInput\\nThis program has two types of input:\\n•\\nThe users’ responses when asked to play the game.\\n•\\nThe players’ choices.\\nOutput\\nThe players’ choices and the winner of each play.

Players enter their choices via the keyboard. Each\\nplayer enters R or r for Rock, P or p for Paper, or S or s for Scissors. While the\\nfirst player enters a choice, the second player looks elsewhere. Once both entries\\nare in, if the entries are valid, the program outputs the players’ choices and declares\\nthe winner of the play. The game continues until one of the players decides to quit\\nthe game. After the game ends, the program outputs the total number of plays and\\nthe number of times that each player won. This discussion translates into the\\nfollowing algorithm:\\n1.\\nProvide a brief explanation of the game and how it is played.\\n2.\\nAsk the users if they want to play the game.\\n3.\\nGet plays for both players.\\n4.\\nIf the plays are valid, output the plays and the winner.\\n5.\\nUpdate the total game count and winner count.\\n6.\\nRepeat Steps 2 through 5 while the users agree to play the game.\\n7.\\nOutput the number of plays and times that each player won.\\nWe will use the enumeration type to describe the objects.\\nenum objectType {ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS};\\nWatch\\nthe Video\\nProgramming Example: The Game of Rock, Paper, and Scissors\\n|\\n477\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

Most recent compilers\\nare also compatible with ANSI/ISO Standard C++. (To be absolutely sure, check your\\ncompiler’s documentation.) The two standards, Standard C++ and ANSI/ISO Standard\\nC++, are virtually the same. The ANSI/ISO Standard C++ language has some features\\nthat are not available in Standard C++, which the remainder of this chapter addresses.\\nIn subsequent chapters, unless specified otherwise, the C++ syntax applies to both\\nstandards. First, we discuss the namespace mechanism of the ANSI/ISO Standard\\nC++, which was introduced in Chapter 2.\\nWhen a header file, such as iostream, is included in a program, the global identifiers in the\\nheader file also become the global identifiers in the program. Therefore, if a global identifier\\nin a program has the same name as one of the global identifiers in the header file, the\\ncompiler generates a syntax error (such as ‘‘identifier redefined’’). The same problem can\\noccur if a program uses third-party libraries. To overcome this problem, third-party vendors\\nbegin their global identifiers with a special symbol. In Chapter 2, you learned that because\\ncompiler vendors begin their global identifier names with an underscore (_), to avoid linking\\nerrors, you should not begin identifier names in your program with an underscore (_).\\nANSI/ISO Standard C++ tries to solve this problem of overlapping global identifier\\nnames with the namespace mechanism.\\nThe general syntax of the statement namespace is:\\nnamespace namespace_name\\n{\\nmembers\\n}\\nwhere members is usually named constants, variable declarations, functions, or another\\nnamespace. Note that namespace_name is a C++ identifier.\\ncout << \"Enter Y/y to play the game: \";\\n//Step 6f\\ncin >> response;\\n//Step 6g\\ncout << endl;\\n}//end while\\ndisplayResults(gameCount, winCount1,\\nwinCount2);\\n//Step 7\\nreturn 0;\\n}//end main\\n//Place the definitions of the functions displayRules,\\n//validSelection, retrievePlay, convertEnum, winningObject,\\n//gameResult, and displayResults as described previously here.\\nNamespaces\\n|\\n485\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

The rules for converting a\\nstring into pig Latin form are as follows:\\n1.\\nIf the string begins with a vowel, add the string \"-way\" at the end\\nof the string. For example, the pig Latin form of the string \"eye\" is\\n\"eye-way\".\\n2.\\nIf the string does not begin with a vowel, first add \"-\" at the end of\\nthe string. Then rotate the string one character at a time; that is,\\nmove the first character of the string to the end of the string until the\\nfirst character of the string becomes a vowel. Then add the string\\n\"ay\" at the end. For example, the pig Latin form of the string\\n\"There\" is \"ere-Thay\".\\n3.\\nStrings such as \"by\" contain no vowels. In cases like this, the letter\\ny can be considered a vowel. So, for this program, the vowels are\\na, e, i, o, u, y, A, E, I, O, U, and Y. Therefore, the pig Latin form\\nof \"by\" is \"y-bay\".\\n4.\\nStrings such as \"1234\" contain no vowels. The pig Latin form\\nof the string \"1234\" is \"1234-way\". That is, the pig Latin form\\nof a string that has no vowels in it is the string followed by the\\nstring \"-way\".\\nInput\\nInput to the program is a string.\\nOutput\\nOutput of the program is the string in the pig Latin form.\\nPROBLEM\\nANALYSIS\\nAND\\nALGORITHM\\nDESIGN\\nSuppose that str denotes a string. To convert str into pig Latin, check the first\\ncharacter, str[0], of str. If str[0] is a vowel, add \"-way\" at the end of str—\\nthat is, str = str + \"-way\".\\nSuppose that the first character of str, str[0], is not a vowel. First, add \"-\" at the\\nend of the string. Then, remove the first character of str from str and put it at the\\nend of str. Now, the second character of str becomes the first character of str.\\nThis process of checking the first character of str and moving it to the end of str if\\nthe first character of str is not a vowel is repeated until either the first character of\\nstr is a vowel or all the characters of str are processed, in which case str does not\\ncontain any vowels.\\nIn this program, we write a function isVowel to determine whether a character is a\\nvowel, a function rotate to move the first character of str to the end of str, and\\n504\\n|\\nChapter 7: User-Defined Simple Data Types, Namespaces, and the string Type\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

In Chapter 2, you learned that C++\\ndata types fall into three categories: simple, structured, and pointers. One of these categories is\\nthe structured data type. This chapter and the next few chapters focus on structured data types.\\nRecall that a data type is called simple if variables of that type can store only one value at a\\ntime. In contrast, in a structured data type, each data item is a collection of other data items.\\nSimple data types are building blocks of structured data types. The first structured data type that\\nwe will discuss is an array. In Chapters 9 and 10, we will discuss other structured data types.\\nBefore formally defining an array, let us consider the following problem. We want to write a\\nC++ program that reads five numbers, finds their sum, and prints the numbers in reverse order.\\nIn Chapter 5, you learned how to read numbers, print them, and find the sum and\\naverage. Suppose that you are given five test scores and you are asked to write a program\\nthat finds the average test score and output all the test scores that are less than the average\\ntest score. (For simplicity, we are considering only five test scores. After introducing\\narrays, we will show how to efficiently process any number of test scores.)\\n//Program to find the average test score and output the average\\n//test score and all the test scores that are less than\\n//the average test score.\\n#include <iostream>\\n#include <iomanip>\\nusing namespace std;\\nint main()\\n{\\nint test0, test1, test2, test3, test4;\\ndouble average;\\ncout << fixed << showpoint << setprecision(2);\\ncout << \"Enter five test scores: \";\\ncin >> test0 >> test1 >> test2 >> test3 >> test4;\\ncout << endl;\\naverage = (test0 + test1 + test2 + test3 + test4) / 5.0;\\ncout << \"The average test score = \" << average << endl;\\nif (test0 < average)\\ncout << test0 << \" is less than the average test score.\" << endl;\\nif (test1 < average)\\ncout << test1 << \" is less than the average test score.\" << endl;\\nif (test2 < average)\\ncout << test2 << \" is less than the average test score.\" << endl;\\nif (test3 < average)\\ncout << test3 << \" is less than the average test score.\" << endl;\\n520\\n|\\nChapter 8: Arrays and Strings\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

The statement in Line 3 inputs the size of the array into arraySize. When the\\ncompiler compiles Line 1, the value of the variable arraySize is unknown. Thus, when\\nthe compiler compiles Line 5, the size of the array is unknown and the compiler will not\\nknow how much memory space to allocate for the array. In Chapter 12, you will learn how to\\nspecify the size of an array during program execution and then declare an array of that size\\nusing pointers. Arrays that are created by using pointers during program execution are\\ncalled dynamic arrays. For now, whenever you declare an array, its size must be known.\\nProcessing One-Dimensional Arrays\\nSome of the basic operations performed on a one-dimensional array are initializing,\\ninputting data, outputting data stored in an array, and finding the largest and/or smallest\\nelement. Moreover, if the data is numeric, some other basic operations are finding the\\nsum and average of the elements of the array. Each of these operations requires the\\nability to step through the elements of the array. This is easily accomplished using a loop.\\nFor example, suppose that we have the following statements:\\nint list[100];\\n//list is an array of size 100\\nint i;\\nThe following for loop steps through each element of the array list, starting at the first\\nelement of list:\\nfor (i = 0; i < 100; i++)\\n//Line 1\\n//process list[i]\\n//Line 2\\nIf processing the list requires inputting data into list, the statement in Line 2 takes the\\nform of an input statement, such as the cin statement. For example, the following\\nstatements read 100 numbers from the keyboard and store the numbers in list:\\nfor (i = 0; i < 100; i++)\\n//Line 1\\ncin >> list[i];\\n//Line 2\\nSimilarly, if processing list requires outputting the data, then the statement in Line 2\\ntakes the form of an output statement. For example, the following statements output the\\nnumbers stored in list.\\n8\\nArrays\\n|\\n525\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Of course, if you know the location (that is, the\\nindex of the largest element in the array), you can easily determine the\\nvalue of the largest element in the array. So let us describe the algo-\\nrithm to determine the index of the first occurrence of the largest\\nelement in an array—in particular, the index of the largest sale amount\\nin the array sales. We will use the index of the first occurrence of the\\nlargest element in the array to find the largest sale.\\nWe assume that maxIndex will contain the index of the first occur-\\nence of the largest element in the array sales. The general algorithm\\nis straightforward. Initially, we assume that the first element in the list is\\nthe largest element, so maxIndex is initialized to 0. We then compare\\nthe element pointed to by maxIndex with every subsequent element\\nin the list. Whenever we find an element in the array larger than the\\nelement pointed to by maxIndex, we update maxIndex so that it\\npoints to the new larger element. The algorithm is as follows:\\nmaxIndex = 0;\\nfor (index = 1; index < 10; index++)\\nif (sales[maxIndex] < sales[index])\\nmaxIndex = index;\\nlargestSale = sales[maxIndex];\\nLet us demonstrate how this algorithm works with an example. Suppose the array sales\\nis as given in Figure 8-6.\\nHere, we determine the largest element in the array sales. Before the for loop begins,\\nmaxIndex is initialized to 0, and the for loop initializes index to 1.

However, you must include\\nthe brackets following the array name. The previous statement is, therefore, equivalent to:\\ndouble sales[] = {12.25, 32.50, 16.90, 23, 45.68};\\nAlthough it is not necessary to specify the size of the array if it is initialized during\\ndeclaration, it is a good practice to do so.\\nPartial Initialization of Arrays during Declaration\\nWhen you declare and initialize an array simultaneously, you do not need to initialize all\\ncomponents of the array. This procedure is called partial initialization of an array\\nduring declaration. However, if you partially initialize an array during declaration, you\\nmust exercise some caution. The following examples help to explain what happens when\\nyou declare and partially initialize an array.\\nThe statement:\\nint list[10] = {0};\\n530\\n|\\nChapter 8: Arrays and Strings\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

There is also a memory space associated with the\\nidentifier myList, and the base address of the array is stored in that memory space.\\nConsider the following statement:\\ncout << myList << endl;\\n//Line 2\\nEarlier, we said that this statement will not give the desired result. That is, this statement\\nwill not output the values of the components of myList. In fact, the statement outputs the\\nvalue stored in myList, which is the base address of the array. This is why the statement\\nwill not generate a syntax error.\\nSuppose that you also have the following statement:\\nint yourList[5];\\nThen, in the statement:\\nif (myList <= yourList)\\n//Line 3\\n.\\n.\\n.\\nthe expression myList <= yourList evaluates to true if the base address of the array\\nmyList is less than the base address of the array yourList; and evaluates to false\\notherwise. It does not determine whether the elements of myList are less than or equal to\\nthe corresponding elements of yourList.\\nThe Web site accompanying this book contains the program\\nBaseAddressOfAnArray.cpp, which clarifies statements such as those in\\nLines 2 and 3.\\nYou might be wondering why the base address of an array is so important. The reason\\nis that when you declare an array, the only things about the array that the computer\\nremembers are the name of the array, its base address, the data type of each compo-\\nnent, and (possibly) the number of components. Using the base address of the array,\\nthe index of an array component, and the size of each component in bytes, the\\ncomputer calculates the address of a particular component. For example, suppose\\nyou want to access the value of myList[3]. Now, the base address of myList is\\n1000. Each component of myList is of type int, so it uses four bytes to store a\\nvalue, and the index of the desired component is 3. To access the value of\\nmyList[3], the computer calculates the address 1000 + 4 * 3 = 1000 + 12 =\\n1012. That is, this is the starting address of myList[3]. So, starting at 1012, the\\ncomputer accesses the next four bytes: 1012, 1013, 1014, and 1015.\\nWhen you pass an array as a parameter, the base address of the actual array is passed to the\\nformal parameter.

The definition of the function contains\\nthe statement list[2] = 28;. This statement stores 28 into list[2]. To access\\nlist[2], the computer calculates the address as follows: 1000 + 4 * 2 = 1008. So,\\nstarting at the address 1008, the computer accesses the next four bytes and stores 28.\\nNote that, in fact, 1008 is the address of myList[2] (see Figure 8-7).

For this reason, you should use the enumeration type for the array index or other\\nintegral data types wherever possible. Note that when using the enumeration type for array\\nindices, use the default values of the identifiers in the enumeration type. That is, the value of\\nthe first identifier must be 0, and so on. (Recall from Chapter 7 that the default values of\\nidentifiers in an enumeration type start at 0; however, the identifiers can be set to other values.)\\nOther Ways to Declare Arrays\\nSuppose that a class has 20 students and you need to keep track of their scores. Because\\nthe number of students can change from semester to semester, instead of specifying the\\nsize of the array while declaring it, you can declare the array as follows:\\nconst int NO_OF_STUDENTS = 20;\\nint testScores[NO_OF_STUDENTS];\\nOther forms used to declare arrays are:\\nconst int SIZE = 50;\\n//Line 1\\ntypedef double list[SIZE];\\n//Line 2\\nlist yourList;\\n//Line 3\\nlist myList;\\n//Line 4\\nThe statement in Line 2 defines a data type list, which is an array of 50 components of type\\ndouble. The statements in Lines 3 and 4 declare two variables, yourList and myList. Both\\nare arrays of 50 components of type double. Of course, these statements are equivalent to:\\ndouble yourList[50];\\ndouble myList[50];\\nSearching an Array for a Specific Item\\nSearching a list for a given item is one of the most common operations performed on a\\nlist. The search algorithm we describe is called the sequential search or linear search.\\nAs the name implies, you search the array sequentially, starting from the first array\\nelement. You compare searchItem with the elements in the array (the list) and continue\\nthe search until either you find the item or no more data is left in the list to compare\\nwith searchItem.\\nConsider the list of seven elements shown in Figure 8-8.\\n35\\n[0] [1]\\n[3]\\n[2]\\n[4] [5] [6]\\n12\\n27\\n18\\n45\\n16\\n38\\nlist\\nFIGURE 8-8\\nList of seven elements\\n542\\n|\\nChapter 8: Arrays and Strings\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

However, you can also prompt the user to input the data during program execution.\\nFor a list of length n, selection sort makes exactly nðn \\x02 1Þ\\n2\\nkey comparisons and 3(n \\x02 1) item\\nassignments.

The next section presents the insertion\\nsort algorithm that reduces the number of comparisons.\\nAuto Declaration and Range-Based For Loops\\nC++11 introduces auto declaration of elements, which allows a programmer to declare\\nand initialize a variable without specifying its type. For example, the following statement\\ndeclares the variable num and stores 15 in it:\\nauto num = 15;\\nBecause the initializer, which is 15, is an int value, the type of num will be int.\\nOne way to process the elements of an array one-by-one, starting at the first element, is\\nto use an index variable, initialized to 0, and a loop. For example, to process the elements\\nof an array, list, you can use a for loop such as the following:\\nfor (int index = 0; index < length; index++)\\n//process list[index]\\nThis chapter uses these types of loops to process the elements of an array.

The first character\\nin the ASCII character set is the null character, which is nonprintable. Also, recall that in\\nC++, the null character is represented as \\'\\\\0\\', a backslash followed by a zero.\\nThe statement:\\nch = \\'\\\\0\\';\\nstores the null character in ch, wherein ch is a char variable.\\nAs you will see, the null character plays an important role in processing character arrays.\\nBecause the collating sequence of the null character is 0, the null character is less than any\\nother character in the char data set.\\nThe most commonly used term for character arrays is C-strings. However, there is a subtle\\ndifference between character arrays and C-strings. Recall that a string is a sequence of zero or\\nmore characters, and strings are enclosed in double quotation marks. In C++, C-strings are\\nnull terminated; that is, the last character in a C-string is always the null character. A character\\narray might not contain the null character, but the last character in a C-string is always the\\nnull character. As you will see, the null character should not appear anywhere in the C-string\\nexcept the last position. Also, C-strings are stored in (one-dimensional) character arrays.\\nThe following are examples of C-strings:\\n\"John L. Johnson\"\\n\"Hello there.\"\\nFrom the definition of C-strings, it is clear that there is a difference between \\'A\\' and\\n\"A\". The first one is character A; the second is C-string A. Because C-strings are null\\nterminated, \"A\" represents two characters: \\'A\\' and \\'\\\\0\\'. Similarly, the C-string\\n\"Hello\" represents six characters: \\'H\\', \\'e\\', \\'l\\', \\'l\\', \\'o\\', and \\'\\\\0\\'. To store\\n\\'A\\', we need only one memory cell of type char; to store \"A\", we need two memory\\ncells of type char—one for \\'A\\' and one for \\'\\\\0\\'. Similarly, to store the C-string\\n\"Hello\" in computer memory, we need six memory cells of type char.\\nConsider the following statement:\\nchar name[16];\\nThis statement declares an array name of 16 components of type char. Because C-strings\\nare null terminated and name has 16 components, the largest string that can be stored in\\nname is of length 15, to leave room for the terminating \\'\\\\0\\'. If you store a C-string of\\nlength 10 in name, the first 11 components of name are used and the last 5 are left unused.\\nThe statement:\\nchar name[16] = {\\'J\\', \\'o\\', \\'h\\', \\'n\\', \\'\\\\0\\'};\\n8\\nC-Strings (Character Arrays)\\n|\\n551\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

We also said that C-strings are null\\nterminated, so the C-string \"Hello\" has six characters even though only five are\\nenclosed in double quotation marks. Therefore, to store the C-string \"Hello\" in\\ncomputer memory, you must use a character array of size 6. The length of a C-string is the\\nnumber of actual characters enclosed in double quotation marks; for example, the length\\nof the C-string \"Hello\" is 5. Thus, in a logical sense, a C-string is a sequence of zero or\\nmore characters, but in the physical sense (that is, to store the C-string in computer\\nmemory), a C-string has at least one character. Because the length of the C-string is the\\nactual number of characters enclosed in double quotation marks, we defined a C-string to\\nbe a sequence of zero or more characters.

Aggregate\\noperations, such as assignment and comparison, are not allowed on arrays. Even the input/\\noutput of arrays is done component-wise. However, the one place where C++ allows\\naggregate operations on arrays is the input and output of C-strings (that is, character arrays).\\nWe will use the following declaration for our discussion:\\nchar name[31];\\nString Input\\nBecause aggregate operations are allowed for C-string input, the statement:\\ncin >> name;\\nstores the next input C-string into name. The length of the input C-string must be less\\nthan or equal to 30. If the length of the input string is 4, the computer stores the four\\ncharacters that are input and the null character \\'\\\\0\\'. If the length of the input C-string is\\nmore than 30, then because there is no check on the array index bounds, the computer\\ncontinues storing the string in whatever memory cells follow name.

For example, the nested for\\nloops:\\nfor (i = 0; i < 10; i++)\\nfor (j = 0; j < 5; j++)\\nfor (k = 0; k < 7; k++)\\ncarDealers[i][j][k] = 0.0;\\ninitialize the entire array to 0.0.\\nWhen declaring a multidimensional array as a formal parameter in a function, you can\\nomit the size of the first dimension but not the other dimensions. As parameters, multi-\\ndimensional arrays are passed by reference only, and a function cannot return a value of\\nthe array type.

Due to noise in the\\ntransmission channel, the transmitted message may become corrupted. That is,\\nthe message received at the destination is not the same as the message transmitted;\\nsome of the bits may have been changed. There are several techniques to check\\nthe validity of the transmitted message at the destination. One technique is to\\ntransmit the same message twice. At the destination, both copies of the message are\\ncompared bit by bit. If the corresponding bits are the same, the message received is\\nerror-free.\\nLet’s write a program to check whether the message received at the destination is\\nerror-free. For simplicity, assume that the secret code representing the message is a\\nsequence of digits (0 to 9) and the maximum length of the message is 250 digits.\\nAlso, the first number in the message is the length of the message. For example, if the\\nsecret code is:\\n7 9 2 7 8 3 5 6\\nthen the actual message is 7 digits long.\\nThe above message is transmitted as:\\n7 9 2 7 8 3 5 6 7 9 2 7 8 3 5 6\\nInput\\nA file containing the secret code and its copy\\nOutput\\nThe secret code, its copy, and a message—if the received code is error-free—in\\nthe following form:\\nCode Digit\\nCode Digit Copy\\n9\\n9\\n2\\n2\\n7\\n7\\n8\\n8\\n3\\n3\\n5\\n5\\n6\\n6\\nMessage transmitted OK.\\nPROBLEM\\nANALYSIS\\nAND\\nALGORITHM\\nDESIGN\\nBecause we have to compare the corresponding digits of the secret code and its copy, we\\nfirst read the secret code and store it in an array. Then we read the first digit of the copy\\nand compare it with the first digit of the secret code, and so on. If any of the\\ncorresponding digits are not the same, we indicate this fact by printing a message next\\nto the digits. Because the maximum length of the message is 250, we use an array of size\\n250. The first number in both the secret code and the copy of the secret code indicates\\nthe length of the code.

In pseudocode,\\nthis function is:\\na.\\nConvert the letter to uppercase.\\nb.\\nFind the index of the array corresponding to this letter.\\nc.\\nIf the index is valid, increment the appropriate count. At this\\nstep, we must ensure that the character is a letter. We are\\ncounting only letters, so other characters—such as commas,\\nhyphens, and periods—are ignored.\\nFollowing this algorithm, the definition of this function is:\\nvoid characterCount(char ch, int list[])\\n{\\nint index;\\nch = toupper(ch);\\n//Step a\\nindex = static_cast<int>(ch)\\n- static_cast<int>('A');\\n//Step b\\nif (0 <= index && index < 26)\\n//Step c\\nlist[index]++;\\n} //end characterCount\\nwriteTotal This function outputs the line count and the letter count. It has three parameters: the\\noutput file stream variable, the line count, and the array to output the letter count.\\nThe definition of this function is:\\n584\\n|\\nChapter 8: Arrays and Strings\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

C++\\nprovides another structured data type, called a struct (some languages use the term\\n‘‘record’’), to group related items of different types. An array is a homogeneous data structure;\\na struct is typically a heterogeneous data structure. The treatment of a struct in this chapter\\nis similar to the treatment of a struct in C. A struct in this chapter, therefore, is a C-like\\nstruct. Chapter 10 introduces and discusses another structured data type, called a class.\\nRecords (structs)\\nSuppose that you want to write a program to process student data. A student record\\nconsists of, among other things, the student’s name, student ID, GPA, courses taken,\\nand course grades. Thus, various components are associated with a student. However,\\nthese components are all of different types. For example, the student’s name is a string,\\nand the GPA is a floating-point number. Because these components are of different\\ntypes, you cannot use an array to group all of the items associated with a student. C++\\nprovides a structured data type called struct to group items of different types.\\nGrouping components that are related but of different types offers several advantages.\\nFor example, a single variable can pass all the components as parameters to a function.\\nstruct: A collection of a fixed number of components in which the components are\\naccessed by name. The components may be of different types.\\nThe components of a struct are called the members of the struct. The general syntax\\nof a struct in C++ is:\\nstruct structName\\n{\\ndataType1 identifier1;\\ndataType2 identifier2;\\n.\\n.\\n.\\ndataTypen identifiern;\\n};\\nIn C++, struct is a reserved word. The members of a struct, even though they\\nare enclosed in braces (that is, they form a block), are not considered to form a\\ncompound statement.

Therefore, if you\\ndefine a struct and also simultaneously declare a struct variable (as in the preceding\\nstatements), then that struct variable becomes a global variable and thus can be\\naccessed anywhere in the program. Keeping in mind the side effects of global variables,\\nyou should first only define a struct and then declare the struct variables.\\nAccessing struct Members\\nIn arrays, you access a component by using the array name together with the relative\\nposition (index) of the component. The array name and index are separated using square\\nbrackets. To access a structure member (component), you use the struct variable name\\ntogether with the member name; these names are separated by a dot (period). The syntax\\nfor accessing a struct member is:\\nstructVariableName.memberName\\nThe structVariableName.memberName is just like any other variable. For example,\\nnewStudent.courseGrade is a variable of type char, newStudent.firstName is a\\nstring variable, and so on. As a result, you can do just about anything with struct\\nmembers that you normally do with variables. You can, for example, use them in assign-\\nment statements or input/output (where permitted) statements.\\nIn C++, the dot (.) is an operator called the member access operator.\\nConsider the following statements:\\nstruct studentType\\n{\\nstring firstName;\\nstring lastName;\\nchar courseGrade;\\n612\\n|\\nChapter 9: Records (structs)\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

It also determines the student’s course grade and stores it\\nin the member courseGrade.\\nvoid readIn(studentType& student)\\n{\\nint score;\\ncin >> student.firstName >> student.lastName;\\ncin >> student.testScore >> student.programmingScore;\\ncin >> student.GPA;\\nscore = (newStudent.testScore + newStudent.programmingScore) / 2;\\nif (score >= 90)\\nstudent.courseGrade = \\'A\\';\\nelse if (score >= 80)\\nstudent.courseGrade = \\'B\\';\\nelse if (score >= 70)\\nstudent.courseGrade = \\'C\\';\\n9\\nRecords (structs)\\n|\\n617\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

Because the components are of different types, we can group them with the\\nhelp of a struct, defined as follows:\\nstruct salesPersonRec\\n{\\nstring ID;\\n//salesperson's ID\\ndouble saleByQuarter[4];\\n//array to store the total\\n//sales for each quarter\\ndouble totalSale;\\n//salesperson's yearly sales amount\\n};\\nBecause there are six salespeople, we use an array of six components, wherein each\\ncomponent is of type salesPersonRec, defined as follows:\\nsalesPersonRec salesPersonList[NO_OF_SALES_PERSON];\\nwherein the value of NO_OF_SALES_PERSON is 6.\\nBecause the program requires us to find the company’s total sales for each quarter, we\\nneed an array of four components to store the data. Note that this data will be used to\\ndetermine the quarter in which the maximum sales were made. Therefore, the\\nprogram also needs the following array:\\ndouble totalSaleByQuarter[4];\\nRecall\\nthat\\nin\\nC++,\\nthe\\narray\\nindex\\nstarts\\nwith\\n0.\\nTherefore,\\ntotalSaleByQuarter[0] stores data for quarter 1, totalSaleByQuarter[1]\\nstores data for quarter 2, and so on.\\nWe will refer to these variables throughout the discussion.\\nThe array salesPersonList is as shown in Figure 9-9.\\n628\\n|\\nChapter 9: Records (structs)\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

The definition of this function is:\\nvoid maxSaleByPerson(ofstream& outData, salesPersonRec list[],\\nint listSize)\\n{\\nint maxIndex = 0;\\nint index;\\nfor (index = 1; index < listSize; index++)\\nif (list[maxIndex].totalSale < list[index].totalSale)\\nmaxIndex = index;\\noutData << \"Max Sale by SalesPerson: ID = \"\\n<< list[maxIndex].ID\\n<< \", Amount = $\" << list[maxIndex].totalSale\\n<< endl;\\n} //end maxSaleByPerson\\nFunction\\nmaxSaleBy\\nQuarter\\nThis function prints the quarter in which the maximum sales were made. To identify\\nthis quarter, we look at the total sales for each quarter and find the largest sales amount.\\nBecause the sales total for each quarter is in the array totalSaleByQuarter, this\\nfunction must have access to the array totalSaleByQuarter. Also, because the\\noutput will be stored in a file, this function must have access to the ofstream variable\\nassociated with the output file. Therefore, this function has two parameters: a para-\\nmeter corresponding to the array totalSaleByQuarter and a parameter corre-\\nsponding to the output file.\\nThe algorithm to find the largest sales amount is the same as the algorithm to find the\\nlargest element in an array (discussed in Chapter 8). The definition of this function is:\\nvoid maxSaleByQuarter(ofstream& outData,\\ndouble saleByQuarter[])\\nProgramming Example: Sales Data Analysis\\n|\\n635\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

The definition of a struct given in Chapter 9 is similar to the definition of a\\nC-struct. However, the members of a C++ struct can be data items as well as functions.\\nC++ provides another structured data type, called a class, which is specifically designed to\\ngroup data and functions. This chapter first introduces classes and explains how to use them\\nand then discusses the similarities and differences between a struct and a class.\\nChapter 9 is not a prerequisite for this chapter. In fact, a struct and a class have similar\\ncapabilities, as discussed in the section ‘‘A struct versus a class’’ in this chapter.\\nClasses\\nChapter 1 introduced the problem-solving methodology called object-oriented design\\n(OOD). In OOD, the first step is to identify the components, called objects. An object\\ncombines data and the operations on that data in a single unit. In C++, the mechanism\\nthat allows you to combine data and the operations on that data in a single unit is called a\\nclass. Now that you know how to store and manipulate data in computer memory and\\nhow to construct your own functions, you are ready to learn how objects are constructed.\\nThis and subsequent chapters develop and implement programs using OOD. This chapter\\nfirst explains how to define a class and use it in a program.\\nA class is a collection of a fixed number of components. The components of a class are\\ncalled the members of the class.\\nThe general syntax for defining a class is:\\nclass classIdentifier\\n{\\nclassMembersList\\n};\\nin which classMembersList consists of variable declarations and/or functions. That is, a\\nmember of a class can be either a variable (to store data) or a function (to manipulate data).\\nFor example, the following statements define the class courseType, with variables and\\nfunctions, to implement the basic properties of a course.\\nclass courseType\\n{\\npublic:\\nvoid setCourseInfo(string cName, string cNo, int credits);\\nvoid print() const;\\nint getCredits();\\nstring getCourseNumber();\\nstring getCourseName();\\n650\\n|\\nChapter 10: Classes and Data Abstraction\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

Also, in the definition of the class, you cannot initialize a\\nvariable when you declare it.\\n•\\nIf a member of a class is a function, you typically use the function\\nprototype to declare that member.\\n•\\nIf a member of a class is a function, it can (directly) access any member of the\\nclass—member variables and member functions. That is, when you write\\nthe definition of a member function, you can directly access any member\\nvariable of the class without passing it as a parameter. The only condition is\\nthat you must declare an identifier before you can use it.\\nIn C++, class is a reserved word, and it defines only a data type; no memory is\\nallocated. It announces the declaration of a class. Moreover, note the semicolon (;) after\\nthe right brace. The semicolon is part of the syntax. A missing semicolon, therefore, will\\nresult in a syntax error.\\nThe members of a class are classified into three categories: private, public, and\\nprotected. This chapter mainly discusses the first two types, private and public.\\nIn C++, private, protected, and public are reserved words and are called member\\naccess specifiers.\\nFollowing are some facts about public and private members of a class:\\n•\\nBy default, all members of a class are private.\\n•\\nIf a member of a class is private, you cannot access it directly from\\noutside of the class. (Example 10-1 illustrates this concept.)\\n•\\nA public member is accessible outside of the class. (Example 10-1\\nillustrates this concept.)\\n•\\nTo make a member of a class public, you use the member access\\nspecifier public with a colon, :.\\nSuppose that we want to define a class to implement the time of day in a program.\\nBecause a clock gives the time of day, let us call this class clockType.

The general rule is that any member that needs to be directly\\naccessed outside of the class is declared public; any member that should not be accessed\\ndirectly by the user should be declared private. For example, the user should be able to\\nset the time and print the time. Therefore, the members that set the time and print the\\ntime should be declared public.\\nSimilarly, the members to increment the time and compare the time for equality should be\\ndeclared public. On the other hand, to prevent the direct manipulation of the member\\nvariables hr, min, and sec, we will declare them private. Furthermore, note that if the\\nuser has direct access to the member variables, member functions such as setTime are not\\nneeded.

Also, you can declare an array of class objects. A class object\\nhas the same scope as other variables. A member of a class has the same scope as a\\nmember of a struct. That is, a member of a class is local to the class. You access\\na class member outside of the class by using the class object name and the\\nmember access operator (.).\\nFunctions and Classes\\nThe following rules describe the relationship between functions and classes:\\n•\\nClass objects can be passed as parameters to functions and returned as\\nfunction values.\\n•\\nAs parameters to functions, class objects can be passed either by value or\\nby reference.\\n•\\nIf a class object is passed by value, the contents of the member variables of\\nthe actual parameter are copied into the corresponding member variables\\nof the formal parameter.\\nReference Parameters and Class Objects (Variables)\\nRecall that when a variable is passed by value, the formal parameter copies the value of\\nthe actual parameter. That is, memory space to copy the value of the actual parameter is\\nallocated for the formal parameter. As a parameter, a class object can be passed by value.\\nSuppose that a class has several member variables requiring a large amount of memory to store\\ndata, and you need to pass a variable by value. The corresponding formal parameter then\\nreceives a copy of the data of the variable. That is, the compiler must allocate memory for the\\nformal parameter, so as to copy the value of the member variables of the actual parameter.\\nThis operation might require, in addition to a large amount of storage space, a considerable\\namount of computer time to copy the value of the actual parameter into the formal parameter.\\nOn the other hand, if a variable is passed by reference, the formal parameter receives only the\\naddress of the actual parameter. Therefore, an efficient way to pass a variable as a parameter is\\nby reference. If a variable is passed by reference, then when the formal parameter changes, the\\nactual parameter also changes. Sometimes, however, you do not want the function to be able\\nto change the values of the member variables. In C++, you can pass a variable by reference\\nand still prevent the function from changing its value by using the keyword const in the\\nformal parameter declaration.

Notice that within\\nthe definition of this function, the object otherClock accesses the member variables hr,\\nmin, and sec. However, these member variables are private. So is there any violation?\\nThe answer is no. The function equalTime is a member of the class clockType, and\\nhr, min, and sec are the member variables. Moreover, otherClock is an object of type\\nclockType. Therefore, the object otherClock can access its private member vari-\\nables within the definition of the function equalTime.\\nThe same is true for any member function of a class. In general, when you write the\\ndefinition of a member function, say, dummyFunction, of a class, say, dummyClass,\\nand the function uses an object, dummyObject of the class dummyClass, then within\\nthe definition of dummyFunction, the object dummyObject can access its private\\nmember variables (in fact, any private member of the class).\\nOnce a class is properly defined and implemented, it can be used in a program. A program\\nor software that uses and manipulates the objects of a class is called a client of that class.\\nWhen you declare objects of the class clockType, every object has its own copy of\\nthe member variables hr, min, and sec. In object-oriented terminology, variables such\\nas hr, min, and sec are called instance variables of the class because every object\\ninstance has its own copy of the data.\\nAccessor and Mutator Functions\\nLet us look at the member functions of the class clockType. The function setTime\\nsets the values of the member variables to the values specified by the user. In other\\nwords, it alters or modifies the values of the member variables. Similarly, the functions\\nincrementSeconds, incrementMinutes, and incrementHours also modify the\\nmember variables. On the other hand, functions such as getTime, printTime, and\\nequalTime only access the values of the member variables. They do not modify the\\nmember variables. We can, therefore, categorize the member functions of the class\\nclockType into two categories: member functions that modify the member variables\\nand member functions that only access, but do not modify, the member variables.\\nThis is typically true for any class. That is, every class has member functions that only\\naccess but do not modify the member variables, called accessor functions, and member\\nfunctions that modify the member variables, called mutator functions.\\nAccessor function: A member function of a class that only accesses (that is, does not\\nmodify) the value(s) of the member variable(s).\\nMutator function: A member function of a class that modifies the value(s) of the member\\nvariable(s).\\n664\\n|\\nChapter 10: Classes and Data Abstraction\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

However, the object declared is still uninitialized.\\n•\\nOn the other hand, suppose a class, say, dummyClass, includes con-\\nstructor(s) with parameter(s) and does not include the default constructor. In\\nthis case, C++ does not provide the default constructor for the class\\ndummyClass. Therefore, when an object of the class dummyClass is\\ndeclared, we must include the appropriate arguments in its declaration.\\nThe following code further explains this. Consider the definition of the following class:\\nclass dummyClass\\n{\\npublic:\\nvoid print() const;\\ndummyClass(int dX, int dY);\\nprivate:\\nint x;\\nint y;\\n};\\nThe class dummyClass has a constructor with parameters.

Given this definition of the class dummyClass,\\nthe following object declaration is legal:\\ndummyClass myObject(10, 25);\\n//object declaration is legal\\nHowever, because the class dummyClass does not contain the default constructor, the\\nfollowing declaration is incorrect and would generate a syntax error:\\ndummyClass dummyObject;\\n//incorrect object declaration\\nTherefore, to avoid such pitfalls, if a class has constructor(s), the class should also include\\nthe default constructor.\\nIn-line initialization of Data Members and the Default Constructor\\nC++11 standard allows the initialization of data members when they are declared in a\\nclass.

The\\ncompiler uses the default constructor to initialize the array of objects. If the array size is\\nlarge, then it is impractical to specify a different constructor with parameters for each object.\\nFor a small-sized array, we can manage to specify a different constructor with parameters.\\nFor example, the following statement declares clocks to be an array of two compo-\\nnents. The member variables of the first component are initialized to 8, 35, and 42,\\nrespectively. The member variables of the second component are initialized to 6, 52, and\\n39, respectively.\\nclockType clocks[2] = {clockType(8, 35, 42), clockType(6, 52, 39)};\\nIn fact, the expression clockType(8, 35, 42) creates an anonymous object of the\\nclass clockType; initializes its member variables to 8, 35, and 42, respectively;\\nand then uses a member-wise copy to initialize the object clock[0].\\nConsider the following statement, which creates the object myClock and initializes its\\nmember variables to 10, 45, and 38, respectively. This is how we have been creating and\\ninitializing objects. In fact, the statement:\\nclockType myClock(10, 45, 38);\\nis equivalent to the statement:\\nclockType myClock = clockType(10, 45, 38);\\nHowever, the first statement is more efficient. It does not first require that an anonymous\\nobject be created and then member-wise copied in order to initialize myClock.\\nThe main point that we are stressing here, and that we discussed in the preceding section,\\nis the following: To avoid any pitfalls, if a class has constructor(s), it should also have the\\ndefault constructor.\\nDestructors\\nLike constructors, destructors are also functions. Moreover, like constructors, a destructor\\ndoes not have a type. That is, it is neither a value-returning function nor a void function.\\nHowever, a class can have only one destructor, and the destructor has no parameters. The\\nname of a destructor is the tilde character (~), followed by the name of the class. For\\nexample, the name of the destructor for the class clockType is:\\n~clockType();\\n1\\n0\\nClasses\\n|\\n679\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

By\\nseparating the design details of a car’s engine from its use, the manufacturer helps the\\ndriver focus on how to drive the car. Our daily life has other similar examples. For\\nthe most part, we are concerned only with how to use certain items, rather than with\\nhow they work.\\nSeparating the design details (that is, how the car’s engine works) from its use is\\ncalled abstraction. In other words, abstraction focuses on what the engine does and\\nnot on how it works. Thus, abstraction is the process of separating the logical\\nproperties from the implementation details. Driving the car is a logical property;\\nthe construction of the engine constitutes the implementation details. We have an\\nabstract view of what the engine does but are not interested in the engine’s actual\\nimplementation.\\nAbstraction can also be applied to data. Earlier sections of this chapter defined a data type\\nclockType.

The only difference between a struct and a class is that, by default, all\\nmembers of a struct are public, and all members of a class are private. You can\\nuse the member access specifier private in a struct to make a member private.\\nIn C, the definition of a struct is similar to the definition of a struct in C++, as given\\nin Chapter 9. Because C++ evolved from C, the standard C-structs are perfectly\\nacceptable in C++. However, the definition of a struct in C++ was expanded to\\ninclude member functions and constructors and destructors. In the future, because a\\nclass is a syntactically separate entity, specially designed to handle an ADT, the\\ndefinition of a class may evolve in a completely different way than the definition of a\\nC-like struct.\\nBoth C++ classes and structs have the same capabilities. However, most programmers\\nrestrict their use of structures to adhere to their C-like structure form and thus do not use\\nthem to include member functions. In other words, if all of the member variables of a\\nclass are public and the class has no member functions, you typically use a struct to\\ngroup these member variables. This is, in fact, how it is done in this book.\\nInformation Hiding\\nThe previous section defined the class clockType to implement the time in a\\nprogram. We then wrote a program that used the class clockType. In fact, we\\ncombined the class clockType with the function definitions to implement the\\noperations and the function main so as to complete the program. That is, the specifica-\\ntion and implementation details of the class clockType were directly incorporated\\ninto the program.\\nIs it a good practice to include the specification and implementation details of a class in\\nthe program? Definitely not. There are several reasons for not doing so. Suppose the\\ndefinition of the class and the definitions of the member functions are directly included in\\nthe user’s program. The user then has direct access to the definition of the class and the\\ndefinitions of the member functions. Therefore, the user can modify the operations in\\nany way the user pleases. The user can also modify the member variables of an object in\\nany way the user pleases. Thus, in this sense, the private member variables of an object\\nare no longer private to the object.\\nIf several programmers use the same object in a project and if they have direct access to\\nthe internal parts of the object, there is no guarantee that every programmer will use the\\nsame object in exactly the same way. Thus, we must hide the implementation details. The\\nuser should know only what the object does, not how it does it. Hiding the implementa-\\ntion details frees the user from having to fit this extra piece of code in the program. Also,\\nby hiding the details, we can ensure that an object will be used in exactly the same way\\nthroughout the project. Furthermore, once an object has been written, debugged, and\\ntested properly, it becomes (and remains) error-free.\\n1\\n0\\nInformation Hiding\\n|\\n683\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

For illustration\\npurposes, we will use the class clockType.\\nTo implement clockType in a program, the user must declare objects of type\\nclockType and know which operations are allowed and what the operations do.\\nSo, the user must have access to the specification details. Because the user is not\\nconcerned with the implementation details, we must put those details in a separate file\\ncalled an implementation file. Also, because the specification details can be too long,\\nwe must free the user from having to include them directly in the program. However, the\\nuser must be able to look at the specification details so that he or she can correctly call the\\nfunctions, and so forth. We must, therefore, put the specification details in a separate file.\\nThe file that contains the specification details is called the header file (or interface file).\\nThe implementation file contains the definitions of the functions to implement the\\noperations of an object. This file contains, among other things (such as the preprocessor\\ndirectives), the C++ statements. Because a C++ program can have only one function,\\nmain, the implementation file does not contain the function main. Only the user\\nprogram contains the function main. Because the implementation file does not contain\\nthe function main, we cannot produce the executable code from this file. In fact, we\\nproduce what is called the object code from the implementation file. The user then links\\nthe object code produced by the implementation file with the object code of the program\\nthat uses the class to create the final executable code.\\nFinally, the header file has an extension h, whereas the implementation file has an extension\\ncpp. Suppose that the specification details of the class clockType are in a file called\\nclockType. The complete name of this file should then be clockType.h. If the\\nimplementation details of the class clockType are in a file—say, clockTypeImp—the\\nname of this file must be clockTypeImp.cpp.\\nThe file clockTypeImp.cpp contains only the definitions of the functions, not\\nthe definition of the class. Thus, to resolve the problem of an undeclared identifier\\n(such as the function names and variable names), we include the header file\\nclockType.h in the file clockTypeImp.cpp with the help of the include\\nstatement. The following include statement is required by any program that uses\\nthe class clockType, as well as by the implementation file that defines the\\noperations for the class clockType:\\n#include \"clockType.h\"\\nNote that the header file clockType.h is enclosed in double quotation marks, not\\nangular brackets. The header file clockType.h is called the user-defined header file.\\nTypically, all user-defined header files are enclosed in double quotation marks, whereas\\nthe system-provided header files (such as iostream) are enclosed between angular\\nbrackets. Also, note that the preceding include statement assumes that the header file\\nclockType.h is in the same directory as the .cpp file (user program).\\nThe implementation contains the definitions of the functions, and these definitions are\\nhidden from the user because the user is typically provided only the object code.\\n684\\n|\\nChapter 10: Classes and Data Abstraction\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

As you have seen in\\nthis section, a static member function of a class does not need any object to be\\ninvoked. It can be called using the name of the class and the scope resolution operator, as\\nillustrated. Therefore, a static member function cannot use anything that depends on\\na calling object. In other words, in the definition of a static member function, you\\ncannot use a non-static member variable or a non-static function unless there is\\nan object declared locally that accesses the non-static member variable or the non-\\nstatic member function.\\nLet us again consider the class illustrate, as defined in Example 10-12. This class\\ncontains both static and non-static member variables. When we declare objects of\\nthis class, each object has its own copy of the member variable x, which is non-static,\\nand all objects share the member variables y and count, which are static. Earlier in\\nthis chapter, we defined the terminology instance variables of a class using the class\\nclockType. However, at that point, we did not discuss static member variables of a\\nclass. A class can have static\\nas well as non-static\\nmember variables. We can,\\ntherefore, make the general statement that non-static member variables of a class are\\ncalled the instance variables of the class.\\n704\\n|\\nChapter 10: Classes and Data Abstraction\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

You have been asked to\\nwrite a program for this juice machine so that it can be put into operation.\\nThe program should do the following:\\n1.\\nShow the customer the different products sold by the juice machine.\\n2.\\nLet the customer make the selection.\\n3.\\nShow the customer the cost of the item selected.\\n4.\\nAccept money from the customer.\\n5.\\nRelease the item.\\nInput\\nThe item selection and the cost of the item.\\nOutput\\nThe selected item.\\nPROBLEM\\nANALYSIS\\nAND\\nALGORITHM\\nDESIGN\\nA juice machine has two main components: a built-in cash register and several\\ndispensers to hold and release the products.\\nCash Register\\nLet us first discuss the properties of a cash register. The register has some cash on\\nhand, it accepts the amount from the customer, and if the amount deposited is more\\nthan the cost of the item, then—if possible—it returns the change. For simplicity, we\\nassume that the user deposits the money greater than or equal to the cost of the\\nproduct. The cash register should also be able to show to the juice machine’s owner\\nthe amount of money in the register at any given time. The following class defines\\nthe properties of a cash register:\\nclass cashRegister\\n{\\npublic:\\nint getCurrentBalance() const;\\n//Function to show the current amount in the cash\\n//register.\\n//Postcondition: The value of cashOnHand is returned.\\nvoid acceptAmount(int amountIn);\\n//Function to receive the amount deposited by\\n//the customer and update the amount in the register.\\n//Postcondition: cashOnHand = cashOnHand + amountIn;\\ncashRegister(int cashIn = 500);\\n//Constructor\\n//Sets the cash in the register to a specific amount.\\nWatch\\nthe Video\\nProgramming Example: Juice Machine\\n|\\n705\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

This definition of the function showSelection is:\\nvoid showSelection()\\n{\\ncout << \"*** Welcome to Shelly\\'s Juice Shop ***\" << endl;\\ncout << \"To select an item, enter \" << endl;\\ncout << \"1 for orange juice (50 cents)\" << endl;\\ncout << \"2 for apple juice (65 cents)\" << endl;\\ncout << \"3 for mango juice (80 cents)\" << endl;\\ncout << \"4 for strawberry banana juice (85 cents)\" << endl;\\ncout << \"9 to exit\" << endl;\\n}//end showSelection\\nsellProduct This function attempts to sell the product selected by the customer. Therefore, it must\\nhave access to the dispenser holding the product. The first thing that this function does is\\ncheck whether the dispenser holding the product is empty. If the dispenser is empty, the\\nfunction informs the customer that this product is sold out. If the dispenser is not empty,\\nit tells the user to deposit the necessary amount to buy the product.\\nIf the user does not deposit enough money to buy the product, sellProduct tells the\\nuser how much additional money must be deposited. If the user fails to deposit enough\\nmoney in two tries to buy the product, the function simply returns the money.\\n(Programming Exercise 13, at the end of this chapter, asks you to revise\\nthe definition of the function sellProduct so that it keeps asking the user to\\nenter the additional amount as long as the user has not entered enough money to\\nbuy the product.) If the amount deposited by the user is sufficient, it accepts the\\nmoney and sells the product. Selling the product means to decrement the number\\nof items in the dispenser by 1 and to update the money in the cash register by\\nadding the cost of the product. (Because this program does not return the extra\\nmoney deposited by the customer, the cash register is updated by adding the\\nmoney entered by the user.)\\nFrom this discussion, it is clear that the function sellProduct must have access to\\nthe dispenser holding the product (to decrement the number of items in the dispenser\\nby 1 and to show the cost of the item) as well as the cash register (to update the cash).\\nTherefore, this function has two parameters: one corresponding to the dispenser and\\nthe other corresponding to the cash register.

By using classes, you can combine data and operations in a single unit. An object,\\ntherefore, becomes a self-contained entity. Operations can directly access the data, but the\\ninternal state of an object cannot be manipulated directly.\\nIn addition to implementing ADT, classes have other features. For instance, classes can\\ncreate new classes from existing classes. This important feature encourages code reuse. In\\nC++, you can relate two or more classes in more than one way. Two common ways to\\nrelate classes in a meaningful way are:\\n•\\nInheritance (‘‘is-a’’ relationship)\\n•\\nComposition (aggregation) (‘‘has-a’’ relationship)\\nInheritance\\nSuppose that you want to design a class, partTimeEmployee, to implement and\\nprocess the characteristics of a part-time employee. The main features associated with\\na part-time employee are the name, pay rate, and number of hours worked. In\\nExample 10-10 (in Chapter 10), we designed a class to implement a person’s name.\\nEvery part-time employee is a person. Therefore, rather than design the class\\npartTimeEmployee from scratch, we want to be able to extend the definition of\\nthe class personType (from Example 10-10) by adding additional members (data\\nand/or functions).\\nOf course, we do not want to make the necessary changes directly to the class\\npersonType—that is, edit the class personType and add and/or delete members.\\nIn fact, we want to create the class partTimeEmployee without making any\\nphysical changes to the class personType by adding only the members that are\\nnecessary. For example, because the class personType already has members to store\\nthe first name and last name, we will not include any such members in the class\\npartTimeEmployee. In fact, these member variables will be inherited from the\\nclass personType. (We will design such a class in Example 11-3.)\\nIn Chapter 10, we extensively studied and designed the class clockType to implement\\nthe time of day in a program. The class clockType has three member variables to store\\nthe hours, minutes, and seconds. Certain applications, in addition to the hours, minutes, and\\nseconds, might also require us to store the time zone. In this case, we would like to extend\\nthe definition of the class clockType and create a class, extClockType, to accom-\\nmodate this new information. That is, we want to derive the class extClockType by\\nadding a member variable—say, timeZone—and the necessary member functions to\\nmanipulate the time (see Programming Exercise 1 at the end of this chapter). In C++, the\\nmechanism that allows us to accomplish this task is the principle of inheritance. Inheritance is\\nan ‘‘is-a’’ relationship; for instance, ‘‘every employee is a person.’’\\nInheritance lets us create new classes from existing classes.

The derived classes inherit the properties of the base classes. So rather than\\ncreate completely new classes from scratch, we can take advantage of inheritance and\\nreduce software development complexity.\\nEach derived class, in turn, can become a base class for a future derived class. Inheri-\\ntance can be either single inheritance or multiple inheritance. In single inheritance,\\nthe derived class is derived from a single base class; in multiple inheritance, the\\nderived class is derived from more than one base class. This chapter concentrates on\\nsingle inheritance.\\nInheritance can be viewed as a treelike, or hierarchical, structure wherein a base class is\\nshown with its derived classes. Consider the tree diagram shown in Figure 11-1.\\nIn this diagram, shape is the base class. The classes circle and rectangle are\\nderived from shape, and the class square is derived from rectangle. Every\\ncircle and every rectangle is a shape. Every square is a rectangle.\\nThe general syntax of a derived class is:\\nclass className: memberAccessSpecifier baseClassName\\n{\\nmember list\\n};\\nin which memberAccessSpecifier is public, protected, or private. When no\\nmemberAccessSpecifier is specified, it is assumed to be a private inheritance.\\n(We will discuss protected inheritance later in this chapter.)\\n1\\n1\\ncircle\\nrectangle\\nsquare\\nshape\\nFIGURE 11-1\\nInheritance hierarchy\\nInheritance\\n|\\n739\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

That is, in the derived class, you can have a member function with\\nthe same name, number, and types of parameters as a function in the\\nbase class, but with different code in the function body. However, this\\nredefinition applies only to the objects of the derived class, not to the\\nobjects of the base class.\\n5.\\nAll member variables of the base class are also member variables of the\\nderived class. Similarly, the member functions of the base class (unless\\nredefined) are also member functions of the derived class. (Remember\\nRule 1 when accessing a member of the base class in the derived class.)\\nThe next sections describe two important issues related to inheritance. The first issue is the\\nredefinition of the member functions of the base class in the derived class. While discussing\\nthis issue, we will also address how to access the private (data) members of the base class\\nin the derived class. The second key inheritance issue is related to the constructor. The\\nconstructor of a derived class cannot directly access the private member variables of the\\nbase class. Thus, we need to ensure that the private member variables that are inherited\\nfrom the base class are also initialized when a constructor of the derived class executes.\\nRedefining (Overriding) Member Functions of the Base Class\\nSuppose that a class derivedClass is derived from the class baseClass.\\nFurther assume that both derivedClass and baseClass have some member\\nvariables. It then follows that the member variables of the class derivedClass\\nare its own member variables, together with the member variables of baseClass.\\nSuppose that baseClass contains a function, print, that prints the values of the\\nmember variables of baseClass. Now derivedClass contains member variables\\nin addition to the member variables inherited from baseClass. Suppose that\\nyou want to include a function that prints the values of the member variables of\\nderivedClass. You can give any name to this function. However, in the class\\nderivedClass, you can also name this function print (the same name used by\\nbaseClass). This is called redefining (or overriding) the member function of the\\nbase class. Next, we illustrate how to redefine the member functions of a base class\\nwith the help of an example.\\nTo redefine a public member function of a base class in the derived class, the\\ncorresponding function in the derived class must have the same name, number, and\\ntypes of parameters. In other words, the name of the function being redefined in the\\nderived class must have the same name and the same set of parameters. If the\\ncorresponding functions in the base class and the derived class have the same name but\\ndifferent sets of parameters, then this is function overloading in the derived class,\\nwhich is also allowed.\\n1\\n1\\nInheritance\\n|\\n741\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

When we declare a\\nderived class object, this object inherits the members of the base class, but the\\nderived class object cannot directly access the private (data) members of the base\\nclass. The same is true for the member functions of a derived class. That is, the\\nmember functions of a derived class cannot directly access the private members of\\nthe base class.\\nAs a consequence, the constructors of a derived class can (directly) initialize only the\\n(public data) members inherited from the base class of the derived class. Thus, when\\na derived class object is declared, it must also trigger the execution of one of the base\\nclass’s constructors. Furthermore, this triggering of the base class’s constructor is\\nspecified in the heading of the definition of a derived class constructor.\\nFirst, let us write the definition of the default constructor of the class boxType.\\nRecall that, if a class contains a default constructor and no values are specified when\\nthe object is declared, the default constructor executes and initializes the object. Because\\nthe class rectangleType contains the default constructor, we do not specify any\\nconstructor of the base class when writing the definition of the default constructor of the\\nclass boxType.\\nboxType::boxType()\\n{\\nheight = 0.0;\\n}\\nTo write the definition of class boxType constructor with parameters, we first write\\nthe class boxType constructor heading including all of the parameters needed for both\\nthe base class and derived class constructors; that is, all the parameters needed for both\\nboxType and rectangleType. Then, to trigger the execution of the base class\\nconstructor with parameters, we add a colon (:) to the heading followed by the name\\nof the constructor of the base class with its parameters in the heading of the definition\\nof the constructor of the derived class. In effect, we ‘‘tack on’’ the base class\\nconstructor to the derived class constructor via a colon. The derived class constructor\\ngets all of the parameters needed for itself and the base class constructor, then passes on\\nthe base class parameters to its constructor.\\n748\\n|\\nChapter 11: Inheritance and Composition\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

As we will see in the next\\nchapter, destructors are typically used to deallocate dynamic memory allocated to the\\nobjects of a class. (A memory space that is allocated during execution time is called a\\ndynamic memory space. The next chapter explains how to create and work with dynamic\\nmemory.) Suppose that a base class and its derived class have destructors. When a derived\\nclass object goes out of scope, it automatically invokes its destructor. When the destructor\\nof the derived class executes, it automatically invokes the destructor of the base class.\\nSo when writing the definition of the destructor of the derived class, an explict call to\\nthe destructor of the base class is not needed. Furthermore, when the destructor of the\\nderived class executes, it executes its own code first and then calls the destructor of the\\nbase class. For example, suppose that class three is derived from class two, class\\ntwo is derived from class one, and these classes have destructors. When an object of\\nclass three goes out of scope, first the destructor of class three executes, then the\\ndestructor of class two executes, and finally, the destructor of class one executes.\\nThat is, the destructors execute in the reverse order.\\nHEADER FILE OF A DERIVED CLASS\\nThe previous section explained how to derive new classes from previously defined classes.\\nTo define new classes, you create new header files. The base classes are already defined,\\nand header files contain their definitions. Thus, to create new classes based on the\\npreviously defined classes, the header files of the new classes contain commands that tell\\nthe computer where to look for the definitions of the base classes. Recall that to include a\\nsystem-provided header file, such as iostream, in a user program, you enclose the\\nheader file between angular brackets; to include a user-defined header file in a program,\\nyou enclose the header file between double quotation marks.\\nSuppose that the definition of the class personType is placed in the header file\\npersonType.h. To create the definition of the class partTimeEmployee, the\\nheader file—say, partTimeEmployee.h—must contain the preprocessor directive:\\n#include \"personType.h\"\\nbefore the definition of the class partTimeEmployee. To be specific, the header file\\npartTimeEmployee.h is as shown below.\\n//Header file partTimeEmployee\\n#include \"personType.h\"\\nclass partTimeEmployee: public personType\\n{\\npublic:\\nvoid print() const;\\n//Function to output the first name, last name, and\\n//the wages.\\n//Postcondition: Outputs\\n//\\nfirstName lastName wages are $$$$.$$\\nInheritance\\n|\\n757\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

The\\npreprocessor first includes the header file test.h and then the header file testA.h. When\\nthe header file testA.h is included, because it contains the preprocessor directive\\n#include \"test.h\", the header file test.h is included twice in the program. The second\\ninclusion of the header file test.h results in compile-time errors, such as the identifier ONE\\nalready being declared. This problem occurs because the first inclusion of the header file\\ntest.h has already defined the variables ONE and TWO. To avoid multiple inclusion of a file\\nin a program, we use certain preprocessor commands in the header file. Let us first rewrite\\nthe header file test.h using these preprocessor commands and then explain their meaning.\\n//Header file test.h\\n#ifndef H_test\\n#define H_test\\nconst int ONE = 1;\\nconst int TWO = 2;\\n#endif\\na.\\n#ifndef H_test means ‘‘if not defined H_test’’\\nb.\\n#define H_test means ‘‘define H_test’’\\nc.\\n#endif means ‘‘end if’’\\nHere, H_test is a preprocessor identifier.\\nThe effect of these commands is as follows: If the identifier H_test is not defined, we\\nmust define the identifier H_test and let the remaining statements between #define\\nand #endif pass through the compiler. If the header file test.h is included the second\\ntime in the program, the statement #ifndef fails and all of the statements until #endif\\nare skipped. In fact, all header files are written using similar preprocessor commands.\\nEXAMPLE 11-4\\nIn Chapter 10, we defined the class integerManipulation to perform various opera-\\ntions, such as reverse thenumber andcount the even digits, odddigits,and zeros on an integer.\\nIn this example, we extend this class so that a prime factorization of an integer between 2 and\\n27 * 1013 can be determined and printed. In order to find the prime factorization of an integer,\\nwe create an array of the first 125,000 prime numbers and then use these prime numbers to\\nfind the factorization (see the related Programming Exercise 19, in Chapter 8).\\nInheritance\\n|\\n759\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

Only member functions of that class can access the private\\nmembers. As discussed previously, the derived class cannot directly access the private\\nmembers of a base class. However, it is sometimes necessary (say, for efficiency and/or to\\nsimplify the code) for a derived class to directly access a private member of a base class.\\nIf you make a private member become public, then anyone can access that member.\\nRecall that the members of a class are classified into three categories: public, private,\\nand protected. A derived class can directly access the protected members of a\\nbase class. So, for a base class to give access to a member to its derived class and still\\nprevent its direct access outside of the class, you must declare that member under\\nmemberAccessSpecifier\\nprotected. Thus, the accessibility of a\\nprotected\\nmember of a class is between public and private.\\nTo summarize, if a member of a base class needs to be accessed by a derived class, that\\nmember is declared under memberAccessSpecifier protected.\\nInheritance as public, protected, or private\\nSuppose class B is derived from class A. Then, B cannot directly access the private\\nmembers of A. That is, the private members of A are hidden in B. What about the\\npublic and protected members of A?

Suppose that we have the following statement:\\npersonalInfo student;\\nWhen the object student enters its scope, the objects bDay and name, which are members\\nof student, also enter their scopes. As a result, one of their constructors is executed. We,\\ntherefore, need to know how to pass arguments to the constructors of the member objects\\n(that is, bDay and name), which occurs when we give the definitions of the constructors of\\nthe class. Recall that constructors do not have a type and so cannot be called like other\\nfunctions. The arguments to the constructor of a member object (such as bDay) are specified\\nin the heading part of the definition of the constructor of the class. Furthermore, member\\nobjects of a class are constructed (that is, initialized) in the order they are declared (not in the\\norder they are listed in the constructor’s member initialization list) and before the containing\\nclass objects are constructed. Another way to think of this is that all of the components that\\nmake up the instance of personalInfo must be built before the instance itself can be\\nbuilt. Thus, in our case, the object name is initialized first because it is the first member listed\\n(in the private section of the class personalInfo definition), then bDay (the second\\nmember listed), and finally student (the instance of personalInfo we are declaring).\\nThe following statements illustrate how to pass arguments to the constructors of the\\nmember objects name and bDay:\\npersonalInfo\\n-name: personType\\n-bDay: dateType\\n-personID: int\\nsetpersonalInfo(string, string, int, int, \\nint, int): void\\nprintpersonalInfo () const: void\\npersonalInfo(string = \"\", string = \"\",\\nint = 1, int = 1, \\nint = 1900, int = 0)\\npersonalInfo\\npersonType\\ndateType\\nFIGURE 11-8\\nUML class diagram of the class personalInfo and composition (aggregation)\\nComposition (Aggregation)\\n|\\n771\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

It is quite difficult, if not impossible, to reuse a function written for one\\nprogram in another program. For some of these reasons, structured programming is not\\nvery efficient for large software development.\\nChapter 10 began with the introduction of classes. We learned how classes are defined\\nand used. Later in that chapter, we concentrated on the data requirements of a problem\\nand the logical operations on that data. With the help of classes, we combined, or\\nencapsulated, the data—and the operations on that data—in a single unit. Also, with\\nthe help of classes, we were able to separate the data and the algorithms to manipulate that\\ndata. However, the functions to implement the operations on the data had direct access to\\nthe data. This chapter explains how to create new classes from existing classes through\\ninheritance and composition. Furthermore, an object has the capability to hide the\\ninformation details. These are some of the features of object-oriented design (OOD).\\nThe three basic principles of OOD are as follows:\\n•\\nEncapsulation—The ability to combine data and operations on that\\ndata in a single unit.\\n•\\nInheritance—The ability to create new objects (classes) from existing\\nobjects (classes).\\n•\\nPolymorphism—The ability to use the same expression to denote\\ndifferent operations.\\nIn OOD, a class is a fundamental entity; in structured programming, a function is a\\nfundamental entity. In OOD, we debug classes; in structured programming, we debug\\nfunctions. In OOD, a program is a collection of interacting objects; in structured program-\\nming, a program is a collection of interacting functions. Also, OOD encourages code reuse.\\nOnce a class becomes error-free, it can be reused in many programs because it is a self-\\ncontained entity. So are functions. But objects contain functions (methods) that are not\\ndesigned to solve specific programming problems. They are built as general service functions\\nthat will be used in any program. They come with their own set of variables and don’t\\nrequire the programmer to spend time rethinking what data to put into the program solution.\\nThey also hide the implementation details, providing greater control of variable values than\\nstructured programs. Object-oriented programming (OOP) implements OOD.\\nTo create objects, we must know how to represent the data and write functions to\\nmanipulate that data. Thus, we must know everything that we have learned in Chapters 2\\nthrough 8. The first eight chapters are essential for any type of programming, whether\\nstructured or object-oriented.\\nC++ supports OOP through the use of classes. We have already examined the first two features\\nofOOP,encapsulationandinheritance,in thischapter andChapter 10.Chapter13 discusses the\\nthird feature of OOD: polymorphism. A polymorphic function or operator has many forms.\\nIn C++, a function name and operators such as +, -, *, and / can be overloaded. An example\\nof function overloading occurs when the function or operator is called, and the specific\\nversion used decided according to the arguments used. For instance, if both operands are\\nObject-Oriented Design (OOD) and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)\\n|\\n773\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Suppose a class has constructors. If no arguments are passed to an object when it\\nis declared, the default constructor is executed; otherwise, one of the constructors with\\nparameters is executed. However, all constructors have the same name.\\nC++ also provides parametric polymorphism. In parametric polymorphism, the (data)\\ntype is left unspecified and then later instantiated. Templates (discussed in Chapter 13)\\nprovide parametric polymorphism. Also, C++ provides virtual functions as a means to\\nimplement polymorphism in an inheritance hierarchy, which allows the run-time selec-\\ntion of appropriate member functions. (Chapter 12 discusses virtual functions.)\\nThere are several OOP languages in existence today, including Ada, Modula-2, Object Pascal,\\nTurbo Pascal, Eiffel, C++, Java, and Smalltalk. The earliest OOP language was Simula,\\ndeveloped in 1967. The OOP terminology is influenced by the vocabulary of Smalltalk, the\\nOOP language largely developed at a Xerox research center during the 1970s. An OOP\\nlanguage uses many ‘‘fancy’’ words, such as methods, message passing, and so forth.\\nOOP is a natural and intuitive way to view the programming process. When we view an\\nobject, we immediately think of what it can do. For example, when we think about a car,\\nwe also think about the operations on the car, such as starting the car and driving the car.\\nWhen programmers think about a list, they also think about the operations on the list,\\nsuch as searching, sorting, and inserting. OOP allows ADT to be created and used. In\\nC++, we implement ADT through the use of classes.\\nObjects are created when class variables are declared. Objects interact with each other via\\nfunction calls. Every object has an internal state and an external state. The private\\nmembers form the internal state; the public members form the external state. Only the\\nobject can manipulate its internal state.\\nIdentifying Classes, Objects, and Operations\\nIn this book’s first 9 chapters, in the problem analysis phase, we analyzed the problem, identified\\nthe data, and outlined the algorithm. To reduce the complexity of the function main, we wrote\\nfunctions to manipulate the data. In Chapter 10, we used the OOD technique and first identified\\nthe objects that made up the overall problem. The objects were designed and implemented\\nindependentlyofthemainprogram.ThehardestpartinOODistoidentifytheclassesandobjects.\\nIn this section, we describe a common and simple technique to identify classes and objects.\\nWe begin with a description of the problem and then identify all of the nouns and verbs. We\\nchoose our classes from the list of nouns, and we choose our operations from the list of verbs.\\nFor example, suppose that we want to write a program that calculates and prints the\\nvolume and surface area of a cylinder. We can state this problem as follows:\\nWrite a program to input the dimensions of a cylinder and calculate and print the\\nsurface area and volume.\\nIn this statement, the nouns are bold, and the verbs are italic. From the list of nouns—\\nprogram, dimensions, cylinder, surface area, and volume—we can easily visualize\\n774\\n|\\nChapter 11: Inheritance and Composition\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

The nouns dimensions, surface area, and volume are\\ncharacteristics of a cylinder and thus can hardly be considered classes.\\nAfter we identify a class, the next step is to determine three pieces of information:\\n•\\nOperations that an object of that class type can perform\\n•\\nOperations that can be performed on an object of that class type\\n•\\nInformation that an object of that class type must maintain\\nFrom the list of verbs identified in the problem description, we choose a list of possible\\noperations that an object of that class can perform, or has performed, on itself. For\\nexample, from the list of verbs for the cylinder problem description—write, input, calculate,\\nand print—the possible operations for a cylinder object are input, calculate, and print.\\nFor the class cylinderType, the dimensions represent the data. The center of the base,\\nradius of the base, and height of the cylinder are the characteristics of the dimensions.\\nYou can input data to the object either by a constructor or by a mutator function.\\nThe verb calculate applies to determining the volume and the surface area. From this, you\\ncan deduce the operations: cylinderVolume and cylinderSurfaceArea. Similarly,\\nthe verb print applies to the display of the volume and the surface area on an output\\ndevice. In Programming Exercise 3 at the end of this chapter, you are asked to design a\\nclass to implement the characteristics of a cylinder.\\nIdentifying classes via the nouns and verbs from the descriptions of the problem is not the\\nonly technique possible.

If the actual parameter is, say, outfile, an object of the\\nclass ofstream, then the output is sent to the device indicated by outfile.\\nAs mentioned in the section, ‘‘C++ Stream Classes,’’ the class ofstream is\\nderived from the class ostream. Therefore, the class ostream is the base\\nclass. In C++, if a formal reference parameter is of the type ostream, it can refer to\\nan object of the class ofstream.\\nIn general, C++ allows a formal reference parameter of the base class type to refer to an\\nobject of the derived class.

These credit hours are needed to calculate both the GPA and the\\nbilling amount. The total credit hours are calculated by adding the credit hours of\\neach course in which the student is enrolled.

Certain applications, in addition to hours, minutes, and\\nseconds, might require you to store the time zone. Derive the class\\nextClockType from the class clockType by adding a member variable\\nto store the time zone. Add the necessary member functions and constructors\\nto make the class functional. Also, write the definitions of the member\\nfunctions and the constructors. Finally, write a test program to test\\nyour class.\\n2.\\nIn this chapter, the class dateType was designed to implement the date in\\na program, but the member function setDate and the constructor do not\\ncheck whether the date is valid before storing the date in the member\\nvariables. Rewrite the definitions of the function setDate and the con-\\nstructor so that the values for the month, day, and year are checked before\\nstoring the date into the member variables. Add a member function,\\nisLeapYear, to check whether a year is a leap year. Moreover, write a\\ntest program to test your class.\\n3.\\nChapter 10 defined the class circleType to implement the basic proper-\\nties of a circle. (Add the function print to this class to output the radius,\\narea, and circumference of a circle.) Now every cylinder has a base and\\nheight, where the base is a circle. Design a class cylinderType that can\\ncapture the properties of a cylinder and perform the usual operations on the\\ncylinder. Derive this class from the class circleType designed in Chap-\\nter 10. Some of the operations that can be performed on a cylinder are as\\nfollows: calculate and print the volume, calculate and print the surface area,\\nset the height, set the radius of the base, and set the center of the base. Also,\\nwrite a program to test various operations on a cylinder.\\n4.\\nAmanda and Tyler opened a business that specializes in shipping liquids, such\\nas milk, juice, and water, in cylinderical containers. The shipping charges\\ndepend on the amount of the liquid in the container. (For simplicity, you\\nmay assume that the container is filled to the top.) They also provide the\\noption to paint the outside of the container for a reasonable amount. Write a\\nprogram that does the following:\\na.\\nPrompts the user to input the dimensions (in feet) of the container\\n(radius of the base and the height).\\nb.\\nPrompts the user to input the shipping cost per liter.\\nc.\\nPrompts the user to input the paint cost per square foot. (Assume that\\nthe entire container including the top and bottom needs to be painted.)\\nd.\\nSeparately outputs the shipping cost and the cost of painting.\\nYour program must use the class cylinderType (designed in\\nProgramming Exercise 3) to store the radius of the base and the height\\nof the container. (Note that 1 cubic feet ¼ 28.32 liters or 1 liter ¼\\n0.353146667 cubic feet.)\\n806\\n|\\nChapter 11: Inheritance and Composition\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Until now, you have studied only the first two data\\ntypes. This chapter discusses the third data type called the pointer data type. You will first\\nlearn how to declare pointer variables (or pointers, for short) and manipulate the data to\\nwhich they point. Later, you will use these concepts when you study dynamic arrays and\\nlinked lists. Linked lists are discussed in Chapter 16.\\nPointer Data Type and Pointer Variables\\nChapter 2 defined a data type as a set of values together with a set of operations. Recall that\\nthe set of values is called the domain of the data type. In addition to these two properties,\\nuntil now, all of the data types you have encountered have one more thing associated with\\nthem: the name of the data type. For example, there is a data type called int. The set of\\nvalues belonging to this data type includes integers that range between –2147483648 and\\n2147483647, and the operations allowed on these values are the arithmetic operators\\ndescribed in Chapter 2. To manipulate numeric integer data in the range –2147483648\\nto 2147483647, you can declare variables using the word int. The name of the data type\\nallows you to declare a variable of that type. Next, we describe the pointer data type.\\nThe values belonging to pointer data types are the memory addresses of your computer. As\\nin many other languages, there is no name associated with the pointer data type in C++.\\nBecause the domain—that is, the set of values of a pointer data type—is the addresses\\n(locations) in memory, a pointer variable is a variable whose content is an address, that is, a\\nmemory location and the pointer variable is said to point to that memory location.\\nPointer variable: A variable whose content is an address (that is, a memory address) and is\\ntherefore said to point to a memory address.\\nDeclaring Pointer Variables\\nAs remarked previously, there is no name associated with pointer data types. Moreover,\\npointer variables store memory addresses. So the obvious question is: If no name is\\nassociated with a pointer data type, how do you declare pointer variables?\\nThe value of a pointer variable is an address or memory space that typically contains some\\ndata. Therefore, when you declare a pointer variable, you also specify the data type of the\\nvalue to be stored in the memory location pointed to by the pointer variable. For\\nexample, if a pointer variable contains the address of a memory location containing an\\nint value, it is said to be an int pointer or a pointer (variable) of type int. As with\\nregular variables, pointers are bound to a data type and they can only contain the\\naddresses of (or point to) variables of the specific data type they were created to hold.\\nIn C++, you declare a pointer variable by using the asterisk symbol (*) between the data\\ntype and the variable name. The general syntax to declare a pointer variable is:\\ndataType *identifier;\\n812\\n|\\nChapter 12: Pointers, Classes, Virtual Functions, Abstract Classes, and Lists\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

The content of p (when properly\\nassigned) points to a memory location of type int, and the content of ch points to a\\nmemory location of type char. So, p is a pointer variable of type int, and ch is a pointer\\nvariable of type char.\\nBefore discussing how pointers work, let us make the following observations. The\\nstatement:\\nint *p;\\nis equivalent to the statement:\\nint*\\np;\\nwhich is equivalent to the statement:\\nint * p;\\nThus, the character * can appear anywhere between the data type name and the variable\\nname.\\nNow, consider the following statement:\\nint* p, q;\\nIn this statement, only p is the pointer variable, not q. Here, q is an int variable. Each\\nvariable must have its own * character placed to the left of it to make it a pointer variable.\\nTo avoid confusion, we prefer to attach the character * to the variable name. So the\\npreceding statement is written as:\\nint *p, q;\\nOf course, the statement:\\nint *p, *q;\\ndeclares both p and q to be pointer variables of type int.\\nNow that you know how to declare pointers, next we will discuss how to make a pointer\\npoint to a memory space and how to manipulate the data stored in these memory\\nlocations.\\nBecause the value of a pointer is a memory address, a pointer can store the address of a\\nmemory space of the designated type. For example, if p is a pointer of type int, p can\\nstore the address of any memory space of type int.

However, you learned how to use pointers to manipulate\\ndata only into memory spaces that were created using other variables. In other words, the\\npointers manipulated data into already existing memory spaces. But you could have\\naccessed these memory spaces through the variables that were used to create them. So\\nwhat is the benefit of using pointers? In this section, you will learn about the power\\nbehind pointers. In particular, you will learn how to allocate and deallocate memory\\nduring program execution using pointers.\\nVariables that are created during program execution are called dynamic variables. With\\nthe help of pointers, C++ creates dynamic variables. C++ provides two operators, new\\nand delete, to create and destroy dynamic variables, respectively. When a program\\nrequires a new variable, the operator new is used. When a program no longer needs a\\ndynamic variable, the operator delete is used.\\nIn C++, new and delete are reserved words.\\nOperator new\\nThe operator new has two forms: one to allocate a single variable and another to allocate\\nan array of variables. The syntax to use the operator new is:\\nnew dataType;\\n//to allocate a single variable\\nnew dataType[intExp];\\n//to allocate an array of variables\\nin which intExp is any expression evaluating to a positive integer.\\nThe operator new allocates memory (as a variable) of the designated type and returns a\\npointer to it—that is, the address of this allocated memory. Moreover, the allocated\\nmemory is uninitialized.\\nConsider the following declaration:\\nint *p;\\nchar *q;\\nint x;\\nThe statement:\\np = &x;\\nstores the address of x in p.

It is accessed indirectly\\nby the pointer returned by new.

When a dynamic variable is no longer\\nneeded, it can be destroyed; that is, its memory can be deallocated. The C++ operator delete\\nis used to destroy dynamic variables. The syntax to use the operator delete has two forms:\\ndelete pointerVariable;\\n//to deallocate a single\\n//dynamic variable\\ndelete [] pointerVariable; //to deallocate a dynamically\\n//created array\\nThus, given the declarations of the previous section, the statements:\\ndelete p;\\ndelete [] name;\\ndelete str;\\ndeallocate the memory spaces that the pointers p, name, and str point to.\\nSuppose p and name are pointer variables, as declared previously. Notice that an expres-\\nsion such as:\\ndelete p;\\nor:\\ndelete [] name;\\nonly marks the memory spaces that these pointer variables point to as deallocated.\\nDepending on the particular operating system, after these statements execute, these\\npointer variables may still contain the addresses of the deallocated memory spaces. In this\\ncase, we say that these pointers are dangling. Therefore, if later you access the memory\\nspaces via these pointers without properly initializing them, depending on the particular\\nsystem, either the program will access a wrong memory space, which may result in\\ncorrupting data now stored in those spaces, or the program may terminate with an error\\nmessage. One way to avoid this pitfall is to set these pointers to NULL after the delete\\noperation. Also note that for the operator delete to work properly, the pointer must\\npoint to a valid memory space.\\nIn Example 12-3, we used the pointer variable radiusPtr to access the memory location of\\nthe variable radius. However, in that example, the radiusPtr pointed to an existing\\nmemory, which was not created during program execution. In the following example, we\\nillustrate how to use the new and delete operators to allocate and deallocate dynamic memory.\\nEXAMPLE 12-5\\nThe following program illustrates how to use the operators new and delete.\\n//This program illustrates how to use the operators new and delete.\\n#include <iostream>\\n//Line 1\\n#include <iomanip>\\n//Line 2\\nDynamic Variables\\n|\\n827\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

Similarly, the statement\\nlist[3] = 78; stores 78 into the fourth component of list (see Figure 12-7).\\nlist[0] 1000\\n1000\\nlist\\nlist[1] 1004\\nlist[2] 1008\\nlist[3] 1012\\nlist[4] 1016\\n1000\\n25\\n78\\nFIGURE 12-7\\nArray list after the execution of the statements list[0] = 25; and\\nlist[3] = 78;\\nIf p is a pointer variable of type int, then the statement:\\np = list;\\ncopies the value of list, which is 1000, the base address of the array, into p. Unlike the\\ncase with the name list, we are allowed to perform increment and decrement opera-\\ntions on the pointer p.\\nAn array name is a constant pointer.\\nEXAMPLE 12-6\\nThe following program segment illustrates how to obtain a user’s response to get the array size\\nand create a dynamic array during program execution.

The statement in Line 3 prompts the\\nuser to enter the size of the array, and the statement in Line 4 inputs the array size into the\\nvariable arraySize. The statement in Line 6 creates an array of the size specified by\\narraySize, and the base address of the array is stored in intList. From this point on,\\nyou can treat intList just like any other array. For example, you can use the array\\nnotation to process the elements of intList and pass intList as a parameter to the\\nfunction.\\nArrays and Range-Based for Loops (Revisited)\\nChapter 8 introduced range-based for loops, which is a feature of C++11 Standard, and\\ndiscussed how it can be effectively used to process the elements of an array. We also\\npointed out that if a formal parameter of a function is an array, a range-based for loop\\ncannot be used on that formal parameter. In this section, we explain why this is the case.\\nConsider the following statements:\\nint *list;\\n//Line 1\\nlist = new int [5];\\n//Line 2\\nfor (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)\\n//Line 3\\nlist [i] = i * i;\\n//Line 4\\nfor (int x: list)\\n//Line 5;\\nillegal range-based for loop\\ncout << x << \" \";\\n//Line 6\\nThe statement in Line 1 declares list to be a pointer variable of type int. During\\nexecution, the statement in Line 2 creates an array of five components of type int and\\nstores the base address of the array into the pointer list. The statements in Lines 3 and 4\\ninitialize the array to which list points. Now, the array to which list points is a\\ndynamic array. So at the compile time, the pointer list, even though it will contain the\\nbase address of an array, has no first and no last elements. Therefore, in the for loop in\\nLine 5, x cannot be initialized to the first element of the array list. Thus, the range-\\nbased for loop in Line 5 is illegal and will result in a syntax (compiler) error. In essence, a\\nrange-based for loop cannot be used on dynamic arrays. The following code shows the\\ntype of syntax errors generated by the compiler when a range-based for loop is used on a\\ndynamic array.\\n1.\\n#include <iostream>\\n2.\\n3.\\nusing namespace std;\\n4.\\n5.\\nint main()\\n6.\\n{\\n834\\n|\\nChapter 12: Pointers, Classes, Virtual Functions, Abstract Classes, and Lists\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

To declare a pointer as a value parameter in a function heading, you use the\\nsame mechanism as you use to declare a variable. To make a formal parameter be a\\nreference parameter, you use & when you declare the formal parameter in the function\\nheading. Therefore, to declare a formal parameter as a reference pointer parameter,\\nbetween the data type name and the identifier name, you must include * to make the\\nidentifier a pointer and & to make it a reference parameter. The obvious question is: In\\nwhat order should & and * appear between the data type name and the identifier to\\ndeclare a pointer as a reference parameter? In C++, to make a pointer a reference\\nparameter in a function heading, * appears before the & between the data type name\\nand the identifier. The following example illustrates this concept:\\nvoid pointerParameters(int* &p, double *q)\\n{\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n}\\nIn the function pointerParameters, both p and q are pointers. The parameter p is a\\nreference parameter; the parameter q is a value parameter. Furthermore, the function\\npointerParameters can change the value of *q, but not the value of q. However, the\\nfunction pointerParameters can change the value of both p and *p.\\nPointers and Function Return Values\\nIn C++, the return type of a function can be a pointer.

Let us look at the\\nstatements in Lines 7 and 9. The statement in Line 7 calls the function callPrint and\\npasses the object pet as the parameter; it generates the fourth line of the output. The\\nstatement in Line 9 also calls the function callPrint but passes the object dog as the\\nparameter; it generates the fifth line of the output. The output generated by the state-\\nments in Lines 7 and 9 shows only the value of name, even though each time a different\\nclass object was passed as a parameter. Because in Line 9, object dog is passed as a\\nparameter to the function callPrint, one would expect that the output generated by\\nthe statement in Line 9 should be the same as the second line of the output. What actually\\noccurred is that for both statements (Lines 7 and 9), the member function print of the\\nbase class petType was executed. This is due to the fact that the binding of the\\nmember function print in the body of the function callPrint occurred at compile\\ntime. Because the formal parameter p of the function callPrint is of type petType, the\\ncompiler associates the function print of the class petType for the statement\\np.print();. More specifically, in compile-time binding, the necessary code to call\\na specific function is generated by the compiler. (Compile-time binding is also known as\\nstatic binding or early binding.)\\nFor the statement in Line 9, the actual parameter is of type dogType. Thus, when\\nthe body of the function callPrint executes, logically the print function of object\\ndog should execute, which is not the case. So, during program execution, how does\\nC++ correct this problem of making the call to the appropriate function? C++\\ncorrects this problem by providing the mechanism of virtual functions. The binding\\nof virtual functions occurs at program execution time, not at compile time. This kind\\nof binding is called run-time binding, late binding, or dynamic binding. More\\nformally, in run-time binding, the compiler does not generate the code to call a\\nspecific function. Instead, it generates enough information to enable the run-time\\nsystem to generate the specific code for the appropriate function call. Run-time\\nbinding is also known as dynamic binding.\\nIn C++, virtual functions are declared using the reserved word virtual. Let us redefine\\nthe previous classes using this feature.\\n854\\n|\\nChapter 12: Pointers, Classes, Virtual Functions, Abstract Classes, and Lists\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

So the pointer pet points to the object dog. Therefore, the output of the statement\\npet->print();\\nis: Name: Tommy, Breed: Siberian Husky\\nClasses and Virtual Destructors\\nOne thing recommended for classes with pointer member variables is that these classes should\\nhave the destructor. The destructor executes automatically when the class object goes out of\\nscope. Thus, if the object creates dynamic memory space, the destructor can be designed to\\ndeallocate that memory space. If a derived class object is passed to a formal parameter of the\\nbase class type, the destructor of the base class executes regardless of whether the derived class\\nobject is passed by reference or by value. Logically, however, the destructor of the derived\\nclass should be executed when the derived class object goes out of scope.\\nTo correct this problem, the destructor of the base class must be virtual. The virtual\\ndestructor of a base class automatically makes the destructor of a derived class virtual.\\nWhen a derived class object is passed to a formal parameter of the base class type, then\\nwhen the object goes out of scope, the destructor of the derived class executes. After\\nexecuting the destructor of the derived class, the destructor of the base class executes.\\nTherefore, when the derived class object is destroyed, the base class part (that is, the\\nmembers inherited from the base class) of the derived class object is also destroyed.\\nIf a base class contains virtual functions, make the destructor of the base class virtual.\\nAbstract Classes and Pure Virtual Functions\\nThe preceding sections discussed virtual functions. Other than enforcing run-time bind-\\ning of functions, virtual functions also have another use, which is discussed in this section.\\nChapter 11 discussed the second principle of OOD—inheritance. Through inheritance\\nwe can derive new classes without designing them from scratch. The derived classes, in\\naddition to inheriting the existing members of the base class, can add their own members\\nand also redefine or override public and protected member functions of the base class.\\nThe base class can contain functions that you would want each derived class to imple-\\nment. There are many scenarios when it is desirable for a class to serve as a base class for a\\nnumber of derived classes; however, the derived classes may contain certain functions that\\nmay not have meaningful definitions in the base class.\\n1\\n2\\nAbstract Classes and Pure Virtual Functions\\n|\\n859\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

As noted in that chapter, from the\\nclass shape, you can derive other classes, such as rectangle, circle, ellipse, and so\\non. Some of the things common to every shape are its center, using the center to move a shape\\nto a different location, and drawing the shape. We can include these in the class shape. For\\nexample, you could have the definition of the class shape similar to the following:\\nclass shape\\n{\\npublic:\\nvirtual void draw();\\n//Function to draw the shape.\\nvirtual void move(double x, double y);\\n//Function to move the shape at the position\\n//(x, y).\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n};\\nBecause the definitions of the functions draw and move are specific to a particular shape,\\neach derived class can provide an appropriate definition of these functions. Note that we\\nhave made the functions draw and move virtual to enforce run-time binding of these\\nfunctions.\\nThis definition of the class shape requires you to write the definitions of the functions\\ndraw and move. However, at this point, there is no shape to draw or move. Therefore,\\nthese function bodies have no code. One way to handle this is to make the body of these\\nfunctions empty. This solution would work, but it has a drawback. Once we write the\\ndefinitions of the functions of the class shape, then we could create an object of this\\nclass and invoke the empty draw and move functions. Because there is no shape to work\\nwith, we would like to prevent the user from creating objects of the class shape. It\\nfollows that we would like to do the following two things—to not include the definitions\\nof the functions draw and move and to prevent the user from creating objects of the\\nclass shape.\\nBecause we do not want to include the definitions of the functions draw and move of the\\nclass shape, we must convert these functions to pure virtual functions. In this case,\\nthe prototypes of these functions are:\\nvirtual void draw() = 0;\\nvirtual void move(double x, double y) = 0;\\nNote the expression = 0 before the semicolon. Once you make these functions pure\\nvirtual functions in the class shape, you no longer need to provide the definitions of\\nthese functions for the class shape.\\nOnce a class contains one or more pure virtual functions, then that class is called an\\nabstract class. Thus, the abstract definition of the class shape is similar to the\\nfollowing:\\n860\\n|\\nChapter 12: Pointers, Classes, Virtual Functions, Abstract Classes, and Lists\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

To make\\nrectangle a nonabstract class so that we can create objects of this class, the class (or its\\nimplementation file) must provide the definitions of the pure virtual functions of its\\nbase class, which is the class shape.\\nNote that in addition to the pure virtual functions, an abstract class can contain instance\\nvariables, constructors, and functions that are not pure virtual. However, the abstract class\\nmust provide the definitions of the constructor and functions that are not pure virtual.\\nThe following example further illustrates how abstract classes work.\\nEXAMPLE 12-9\\nIn Chapter 11, we defined the class partTimeEmployee, which was derived from the\\nclass personType, to illustrate inheritance. We also noted that there are two types of\\nemployees: full-time and part-time. The base salary of a full-time employee is usually\\nfixed for a year. In addition, a full-time employee may receive a bonus. On the other\\nhand, the salary of a part-time employee is usually calculated according to the pay rate per\\nhour and the number of hours worked. In this example, we first define the class\\nemployeeType, derived from the class personType, to store an employee’s name\\nand ID. We include functions to set the ID and retrieve the ID. We also include pure\\nvirtual functions print and calculatePay to print an employee’s data, which\\nincludes the employee’s ID, name, and wages.\\nFrom the class employeeType, we derive the classes fullTimeEmployee and\\npartTimeEmployee and provide the definitions of the pure virtual functions of the\\nclass employeeType.\\n1\\n2\\nAbstract Classes and Pure Virtual Functions\\n|\\n861\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

Using these\\nfeatures, this section discusses how to use arrays to manipulate lists. Let us first make the\\nfollowing definition.\\nList: A collection of elements of the same type.\\nThe length of a list is the number of elements in the list. Some of the operations\\nperformed on a list are as follows:\\n1.\\nCreate the list. The list is initialized to an empty state.\\n2.\\nDetermine whether the list is empty.\\n3.\\nDetermine whether the list is full.\\n4.\\nFind the size of the list.\\n5.\\nDestroy, or clear, the list.\\n6.\\nDetermine whether an item is the same as a given list element.\\n7.\\nInsert an item in the list at the specified location.\\n8.\\nRemove an item from the list at the specified location.\\n9.\\nReplace an item at the specified location with another item.\\n10.\\nRetrieve an item from the list at the specified location.\\n11.\\nSearch the list for a given item.\\nThe list we create can be sorted or unsorted. However, the algorithms to implement\\ncertain operations are the same whether the list is sorted or unsorted. For example, a list,\\nsorted or unsorted, is empty if the length of the list is empty. However, the search\\nalgorithms for sorted and unsorted lists are typically different. Therefore, next we create\\nthe abstract class that implements some of these operations. We will separately describe\\nthe classes to create sorted and unsorted lists. However, we must first decide how to store\\nthe list in the computer’s memory.\\nBecause all the elements of a list are of the same type, an effective, convenient, and a\\ncommon way to process a list is to store it in an array. Initially, the size of the array\\nholding the list elements is usually larger than the number of elements in the list so that, at\\na later stage, the list can grow to a specific size. Thus, we must know how full the array is,\\nthat is, we must keep track of the number of list elements stored in the array. Now, C++\\nallows the programmer to create dynamic arrays. Therefore, we will leave it for the user\\nto specify the size of the array. The size of the array can be specified when a list object is\\ndeclared. It follows that, in order to maintain and process the list in an array, we need the\\nfollowing three variables:\\n868\\n|\\nChapter 12: Pointers, Classes, Virtual Functions, Abstract Classes, and Lists\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

Moreover notice that the functions insertAt, insertEnd, replaceAt,\\nseqSearch, insert, and remove are declared as abstract. This is because, as noted\\nearlier, typically we deal with two types of lists—lists whose elements are arranged\\naccording to some criteria, such as sorted list, and lists whose elements are in no particular\\norder, unsorted lists. The algorithms to implement the operations, search, insert, and\\nremove slightly differs for sorted and unsorted lists. Therefore, by using the principle of\\ninheritance, from the class arrayListType, we in fact, will derive two classes:\\norderedArrayListType and unorderedArrayListType.\\nObjects of the class unorderedArrayListType would arrange list elements in no\\nparticular order, that is, these lists are unsorted. On the other hand, objects of the class\\norderedArrayListType would arrange elements according to some comparison criteria,\\nusually, greater than or equal to. That is, these lists will be in ascending order. Moreover,\\nafter inserting an element into or removing an element from an ordered list, the resulting\\nlist will be ordered. We will, therefore, separately describe the algorithm to implement the\\noperations search, insert, and remove for unsorted and sorted lists. Because each of the classes\\norderedArrayListType and unorderedArrayListType will provide separate definitions\\nof the functions insertAt, insertEnd, replaceAt, seqSearch, insert, and remove,\\nand because these functions would access the instance variable, to provide direct access to\\nthe instance variables, the instance variables are declared as protected.\\nNext, we write the definitions of the nonabstract functions.\\nThe list is empty if length is 0; it is full if length is equal to maxSize. Therefore, the\\ndefinitions of the functions isEmpty and isFull are\\nbool arrayListType::isEmpty() const\\n{\\nreturn (length == 0);\\n} //end isEmpty\\nbool arrayListType::isFull() const\\n{\\nreturn (length == maxSize);\\n} //end isFull\\nThe member variable length of the class arrayListType stores the number of\\nelements currently in the list. Similarly, because the size of the array holding the list\\nelements is stored in the member variable maxSize, maxSize specifies the maximum size\\nof the list. Therefore, the definitions of the functions listSize and maxListSize are\\nint arrayListType::listSize() const\\n{\\nreturn length;\\n} //end listSize\\nint arrayListType::maxListSize() const\\n{\\nreturn maxSize;\\n} //end maxListSize\\n872\\n|\\nChapter 12: Pointers, Classes, Virtual Functions, Abstract Classes, and Lists\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

However, in\\na list an element may repeat. That is, the elements of the list need not be distinct. On\\nthe other hand, a set is also a collection of elements of the same type. However, the\\nelements of a set are distinct. It follows that a set is a list with distinct elements. In this\\nsection we designed the class unorderedArrayListType to process unordered\\nlists. Note that the functions insertAt and insertEnd do not check whether the item\\nto be inserted is already in the list. Similarly, the function replaceAt, does not check if\\nthe item to be replaced is already in the list. Just as you can design a class to manipulate\\nlists, you can also design a class to manipulate sets. Programming Exercise 12, at the end\\nof this chapter asks you to design the class unorderedSetType, derived from the\\nclass unorderedArrayListType, to manipulate sets.\\nOrdered Lists\\nAs described earlier we derive two classes from the abstract class arrayListType,\\nwhich are: unorderedArrayListType and orderedArrayListType. Elements of an\\nunorderedArrayListType object are in no particular order. However, elements of an\\nobject orderedArrayListType are in ascending order. The preceding section described\\nthe operation of the class unorderedArrayListType. This section describes the\\nclass orderedArrayListType.\\nThe class orderedArrayListType also contains the function insert to insert an item\\nat the proper place in the list.

When an integer is\\nadded to a pointer, the value added to the value of the pointer variable is\\nthe integer times the size of the object to which the pointer is pointing.\\nSimilarly, when an integer is subtracted from a pointer, the value subtracted\\nfrom the value of the pointer variable is the integer times the size of the\\nobject to which the pointer is pointing.\\n13.\\nPointer variables can be compared using relational operators. (It makes\\nsense to compare pointers of the same type.)\\n884\\n|\\nChapter 12: Pointers, Classes, Virtual Functions, Abstract Classes, and Lists\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

You must\\nask the user for the number of candidates and then create the appropriate\\narrays to hold the data.\\n4.\\nProgramming Exercise 11 in Chapter 8 explains how to add large integers using\\narrays. However, in that exercise, the program could add only integers of, at\\nmost, 20 digits. This chapter explains how to work with dynamic integers.\\nDesign a class named largeIntegers such that an object of this class can\\nstore an integer of any number of digits. Add operations to add, subtract,\\nmultiply, and compare integers stored in two objects. Also add constructors\\nto properly initialize objects and functions to set, retrieve, and print the values\\nof objects.\\n5.\\nBanks offer various types of accounts, such as savings, checking, certificate\\nof deposits, and money market, to attract customers as well as meet their\\nspecific needs. Two of the most commonly used accounts are savings and\\nchecking. Each of these accounts has various options. For example, you may\\nhave a savings account that requires no minimum balance but has a lower\\ninterest rate. Similarly, you may have a checking account that limits the\\nnumber of checks you may write. Another type of account that is used to\\nsave money for the long term is certificate of deposit (CD).\\nIn this programming exercise, you use abstract classes and pure virtual\\nfunctions to design classes to manipulate various types of accounts. For\\nsimplicity, assume that the bank offers three types of accounts: savings,\\nchecking, and certificate of deposit, as described next.\\nSavings accounts: Suppose that the bank offers two types of savings\\naccounts: one that has no minimum balance and a lower interest rate and\\nanother that requires a minimum balance and has a higher interest rate.\\nChecking accounts: Suppose that the bank offers three types of checking\\naccounts: one with a monthly service charge, limited check writing, no\\nminimum balance, and no interest; another with no monthly service charge,\\na minimum balance requirement, unlimited check writing and lower interest;\\nand a third with no monthly service charge, a higher minimum requirement, a\\nhigher interest rate, and unlimited check writing.\\nCertificate of deposit (CD): In an account of this type, money is left for\\nsome time, and these accounts draw higher interest rates than savings or\\nchecking accounts. Suppose that you purchase a CD for six months. Then\\nwe say that the CD will mature in six months. The penalty for early\\nwithdrawal is stiff.\\nFigure 12-25 shows the inheritance hierarchy of these bank accounts.\\n1\\n2\\nProgramming Exercises\\n|\\n897\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

Chapter 10 defined the abstract data type (ADT) and described how classes in\\nC++ implement ADT.

The second\\nstatement increments the value of myClock by one second. The third statement checks\\nwhether the value of myClock is the same as the value of yourClock.\\nThese statements do their job.

Therefore, other operators cannot be directly applied to\\nclass objects by default. However, C++ allows the programmer to extend the\\ndefinitions of operators such as relational operators, arithmetic operators, the insertion\\noperator for data output, and the extraction operator for data input—so they can be\\napplied to classes. In C++ terminology, this is called operator overloading.\\nOperator Overloading\\nRecall how the arithmetic operator / works. If both operands of / are integers, the result\\nis an integer; otherwise, the result is a floating-point number. This means that the /\\noperator has one definition when both operands are integers and another when an\\noperand is a floating-point number. Which definition is used depends on the data types\\nof the operand it is used with. Similarly, the stream insertion operator, <<, and the stream\\nextraction operator, >>, are overloaded. The operator >> is used as both a stream\\nextraction operator and a right shift operator. The operator << is used as both a stream\\ninsertion operator and a left shift operator. These are examples of operator overloading.\\n(Note that the operators << and >> have also been overloaded for various data types, such\\nas int, double, and string.)\\nOther examples of overloaded operators are + and -. The results of + and - are different\\nfor integer arithmetic, floating-point arithmetic, and pointer arithmetic.\\nC++ allows the user to overload most of the operators so that the operators can work\\neffectively in a specific application. It does not allow the user to create new operators.\\nMost of the existing operators can be overloaded to manipulate class objects.\\nIn order to overload an operator, you must write function(s) (that is, the header and\\nbody) to define what operation the overloaded operator indicates should be performed.\\nThe name of the function that overloads an operator is the reserved word operator\\nfollowed by the operator to be overloaded. For example, the name of the function to\\noverload the operator >= is:\\noperator>=\\nOperator function: The function that overloads an operator.\\n1\\n3\\nOperator Overloading\\n|\\n903\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

Sometimes, it is necessary for a member function to refer to the\\nobject as a whole, rather than the object’s individual member variables. How do you\\nrefer to the object as a whole (that is, as a single unit) in the definition of the member\\nfunction, especially when the object is not passed as a parameter? Every object of a\\nclass maintains a (hidden) pointer to itself, and the name of this pointer is this. In\\nC++, this is a reserved word. The pointer this (in a member function) is available\\nfor you to use. When an object invokes a member function, the member function\\nreferences the pointer this of the object. For example, suppose that test is a class\\nand has a member function called one. Further suppose that the definition of one\\nlooks like the following:\\ntest test::one()\\n{\\n.\\n.\\n.\\nreturn *this;\\n}\\nIf x and y are objects of type test, then the statement:\\ny = x.one();\\ncopies the value of object x into object y. That is, the member variables of x are copied\\ninto the corresponding member variables of y. When object x invokes function one, the\\npointer this in the definition of member function one refers to object x, so this means\\nthe address of x and *this means the contents of x. On the other hand, in the statement\\nx = y.one();\\nthe pointer this in the definition of member function one refers to object y, and so\\nthis means the address of y and *this means the contents of y. So the statement copies\\nthe contents of object y into object x.\\nThe following example illustrates how the pointer this works.\\n1\\n3\\nOperator Overloading\\n|\\n907\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

To make a function be a friend to a\\nclass, the reserved word friend precedes the function prototype (in the class definition).\\nThe word friend appears only in the function prototype in the class definition, not in\\nthe definition of the friend function.

That is, it is a nonmember function of the class\\nclassIllusFriend. When you write the definition of the function two, any object\\nof type classIllusFriend, which is included in the definition as either a local variable\\nof two or a formal parameter of two, can access its private members within the\\ndefinition of the function two. (Example 13-4 illustrates this concept.) Moreover,\\nbecause a friend function is not a member of a class, its declaration can be placed\\nwithin the private, protected, or public part of the class. However, they are\\ntypically placed before any member function declaration.\\nDEFINITION OF A friend FUNCTION\\nWhen writing the definition of a friend function, the name of the class and the scope\\nresolution operator do not precede the name of the friend function in the function\\nheading because it is not a member function of the class. Also, recall that the word\\nfriend does not appear in the heading of the friend function’s definition. Thus, the\\ndefinition of the function two in the previous class classIllusFriend is:\\nvoid two(/*parameters*/)\\n{\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n}\\nOf course, we will place the definition of the friend function in the implementation file.\\nThe next section illustrates the difference between a member function and a nonmember\\nfunction (friend function) when we overload some of the operators for a specific class.\\nThe following example shows how a friend function accesses the private members of\\na class.\\n912\\n|\\nChapter 13: Overloading and Templates\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

This section describes these rules.\\nMost operator functions can be either member functions or nonmember functions—that\\nis, friend functions of a class. To make an operator function be a member or non-\\nmember function of a class, keep the following in mind:\\n1.\\nThe function that overloads any of the operators (), [], ->, or = for a\\nclass must be declared as a member of the class.\\n2.\\nSuppose that an operator op is overloaded for a class—say, opOverClass.\\n(Here, op stands for an operator that can be overloaded, such as + or >>.)\\na.\\nIf the far left operand of op is an object of a different type (that is,\\nnot of type opOverClass), the function that overloads the operator\\nop for opOverClass must be a nonmember—that is, a friend of\\nthe class opOverClass.\\nb.\\nIf the operator function that overloads the operator op for the\\nclass opOverClass is a member of the class opOverClass,\\nthen when applying op on objects of type opOverClass, the far\\nleft operand of op must be of type opOverClass.\\nYou must follow these rules when including an operator function in a class definition.\\nYou will see later in this chapter that functions that overload the insertion operator, <<,\\nand the extraction operator, >>, for a class must be nonmembers—that is, friend\\nfunctions of the class.\\nExcept for certain operators noted previously, operators can be overloaded either as\\nmember functions or as nonmember functions. The following discussion shows the\\ndifference between these two types of functions.\\nTo facilitate our discussion of operator overloading, we will use the class rectangleType,\\ngiven next.

The sample run clearly shows that the destruction of\\nintList2 affects neither intList1 nor intList3, because intList1 and intList3\\neach have their own data.\\nOverloading Unary Operators\\nThe process of overloading unary operators is similar to the process of overloading binary\\noperators. The only difference is that in the case of binary operators, the operator has two\\noperands. In the case of unary operators, the operator has only one parameter. Therefore,\\nto overload a unary operator for a class:\\n1.\\nIf the operator function is a member of the class, it has no parameters.\\n2.\\nIf the operator function is a nonmember—that is, a friend function of\\nthe class—it has one parameter.\\nNext, we describe how to overload the increment and decrement operators.\\nOVERLOADING THE INCREMENT (++) AND DECREMENT (--) OPERATORS\\nThe increment operator has two forms: pre-increment (++u) and post-increment (u++), in\\nwhich u is a variable, say, of type int. In the case of pre-increment, ++u, the value of the\\nvariable, u, is incremented by 1 before the value of u is used in an expression. In the case of\\npost-increment, the value of u is used in the expression before it is incremented by 1.\\nOverloading the Pre-Increment Operator. Overloading the pre-increment operator is quite\\nstraightforward. In the function definition, first we increment the value of the object,\\nand then we use the pointer this to return the object’s value.\\nFor example, suppose that we overload the pre-increment operator for the class\\nrectangleType to increment the length and width of a rectangle by 1. Also, suppose\\nthat the operator function operator++ is a member of the class rectangleType.\\nThe operator function operator++ then has no parameters and we use the pointer\\nthis to return the incremented value of the object:\\nrectangleType rectangleType::operator++()\\n{\\n//increment the length and width\\n++length;\\n++width;\\nreturn *this; //return the incremented value of the object\\n}\\nOperator Overloading\\n|\\n937\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

As in the case of the pre-\\nincrement operator, we first describe the overloading of this operator as a member of a class.\\nLet us overload the post-increment operator for the class rectangleType. In both cases,\\npre- and post-increment, the name of the operator function is the same—operator++. To\\ndistinguish between pre- and post-increment operator overloading, we use a dummy\\nparameter (of type int) in the function heading of the operator function. The dummy\\nparameter is not used in the definition of the function. Its only purpose is to distinguish\\nbetween the pre- and post-increment versions of operator++. Thus, the function\\nprototype for the post-increment operator of the class rectangleType is:\\nrectangleType operator++(int);\\nThe statement:\\nmyRectangle++;\\nis compiled by the compiler in the statement:\\nmyRectangle.operator++(0);\\nand so the function operator++ with a parameter executes. Notice that the parameter 0\\nis only used to distinguish between the pre- and post-increment operator functions.\\nThe post-increment operator first uses the value of the object in the expression and then\\nincrements the value of the object. So the steps required to implement this function are:\\n1.\\nSave the value of the object—in, say, temp.\\n2.\\nIncrement the value of the object.\\n3.\\nReturn the value that was saved in temp.\\nThe function definition of the post-increment operator for the class rectangleType is:\\nrectangleType rectangleType::operator++(int u)\\nOperator Overloading\\n|\\n939\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

Certain\\noperators must be overloaded as member functions of the class, and some must be\\noverloaded as nonmember (friend) functions. What about the operators that can be\\noverloaded as either member functions or nonmember functions? For example, the\\nbinary arithmetic operator + can be overloaded as a member function or a nonmember\\nfunction. If you overload + as a member function, then the operator + has direct access to\\nthe member variables of one of the objects, and you need to pass only one object as a\\n1\\n3\\nOperator Overloading\\n|\\n943\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.

On the other hand, if you overload + as a nonmember function, then you must\\npass both objects as parameters. When both objects are passed as parameters, the code may\\nbecome somewhat clearer. So, other than following the restrictions on operator overloading,\\nit is a matter of preference whether you overload + as a member or as a nonmember\\nfunction. In the remainder of this chapter, if we overload an operator as a member function,\\nwe will leave it as an exercise for you to overload it as a nonmember function.\\nClasses and Pointer Member Variables (Revisited)\\nChapter 12 described the peculiarities of classes with pointer member variables. Now that\\nwe have discussed how to overload various operators, let us review the peculiarities of classes\\nwith pointer member variables, for the sake of completeness, and how to avoid them.\\nRecall that the only built-in operations on classes are assignment and member selection.\\nThe assignment operator provides a member-wise copy of the data. That is, the member\\nvariables of an object are copied into the corresponding member variables of another\\nobject of the same type. We have seen that this member-wise copy does not work well\\nfor classes with pointer member variables. Other problems that may arise with classes with\\npointer member variables relate to deallocating dynamic memory when an object goes\\nout of scope and passing a class object as a parameter by value. To resolve these problems,\\nclasses with pointer member variables must:\\n1.\\nExplicitly overload the assignment operator\\n2.\\nInclude the copy constructor\\n3.\\nInclude the destructor\\nOperator Overloading: One Final Word\\nNext, we look at three examples that illustrate operator overloading. Before delving into\\nthese examples, you must remember the following: Suppose that an operator op is\\noverloaded for a class—say, rectangleType. Whenever we use the operator op on\\nobjects of type rectangleType, the body of the function that overloads the operator op\\nfor the class rectangleType executes. Therefore, whatever code you put in the body\\nof the function executes.\\nPROGRAMMING EXAMPLE: clockType\\nChapter 10 defined a class clockType to implement the time of day in a program.\\nWe implemented the operations to print the time, increment the time, and compare\\nthe two times for equality using functions. This example redefines the class\\nclockType. It also overloads the stream insertion and extraction operators for easy\\ninput and output, relational operators for comparisons, and the increment operator to\\nincrement the time by one second. The program that uses the class clockType\\nrequires the user to input the time in the form hr:min:sec.\\nWatch\\nthe Video\\n944\\n|\\nChapter 13: Overloading and Templates\\nCopyright 2015 Cengage Learning.
